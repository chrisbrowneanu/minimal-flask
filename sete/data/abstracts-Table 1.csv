20598,"Overview: For T&E to provide the most relevant information for developing and fielding capabilities to meet mission needs, planning should focus on gathering data for capability evaluation and decision-support. We propose an expansion of US DoD's acquisition cycle mandated Integrated Decision Support Key (IDSK) to Decision Support Evaluation Framework (DSEF) which guides a structured decision-evaluation-data critical thought process throughout the full capability development lifecycle. - Context: IDSK guides data collection from test and modeling and simulation (M&S) events for an acquisition system’s operational and technical capabilities’ evaluation for operational, programmatic, and technical decision-support throughout acquisition lifecycle. As T&E expands outside the confines of the acquisition cycle to the full capability lifecycle, the DSEF provides the same expansion of the test’s evaluation and decision-support. - Purpose: In moving from IDSK to DSEF, we must scale from the acquisition cycle to the full capability development cycle. The “art” and critical thought in developing a DSEF is properly stating the decision space (i.e., What decision needs to be made? When does the decision need to be made? What is the essence of the information needed by the decision-maker to make an informed decision?) and aligning it with the appropriate capability evaluation and data sources. We describe the decision space as a concept moves from early capability development planning, through S&T and P&E, to PoR and Operational SoS Architecture mission delivery. - Approach: Through analysis of the various stages in the capability development process, we've defined classes of decisions, decision-supporting questions, and capability evaluation strategies. - Insights: The value of the DSEF is two-fold. First, the DSEF thought process guides the capability evaluation planning focused on informing decisions. Second, the DSEF process guides wargames and exercise planning with a more rigorous focus on gathering the data needed for evaluation and decision-support.

20604,"This presentation delves into the transformative realm of virtual rehearsal and its profound benefits for the construction industry, spotlighting a recent Australian project exemplifying cast-in-place construction methodologies. The focus will be on the utilization of innovative techniques such as incrementally launched casting beds and balanced cantilevers from travellers. Subsequently, we will elucidate how these design principles can be seamlessly applied to more conventional structures and methodologies.
Virtual rehearsal, a digital technique, empowers project teams to meticulously plan, test, and refine work sequences within a simulated environment before embarking on real-world implementation. Leveraging building information models (BIM), this form of virtual reality enables collaborative interactions among personnel involved in planning and executing tasks. The immersive technology facilitates a dynamic interaction with designs, allowing for the rehearsal of various aspects of construction, maintenance, repurposing, and risk assessment within the context of new infrastructure.
Key Points:
-Integration of virtual 3D models with the project program for visualizing and analyzing construction activities.
-Visualization and analysis of project design before and during construction phases.
-Enhancement of user understanding regarding the spatial relationships within the project.
-Identification and proactive addressing of safety concerns or potential issues.
Advantages:
-Establishment of rich engagement with owner/operator stakeholders through immersive experiences.
-Improvement of design and service outcomes through engaged reviews, comments, and option testing.
-Automated prevention of safety risks, reducing reliance on human behavior.
-Stakeholders gain a comprehensive understanding of the design, facilitating informed decisions early in the construction process.

20608,"The burgeoning adoption of Robotic and Autonomous Systems with Artificial Intelligence (RAS-AI) necessitates standardized approaches for Systems Engineering of AI-intensive systems (SE4AI) and Assurance of AI-intensive systems (As4AI). There is an increasing recognition of the need to employ simulated environments in an As4AI context, which in turn necessitates standardized approaches for the Systems Engineering of simulated environments (SE4SimE) and Assurance of Simulated Environments (As4SimE).
This paper outlines a conceptual framework and methodology for the assurance of simulated environments (As4SimE) used in the assurance certification of (maritime) autonomous systems. It does this by first contextualizing As4AI in a (maritime) autonomous systems context, to highlight the need for simulated environments, and in the need for an associated As4SimE framework. This is followed by a literature and market review to identify enabling concepts and to identify gaps in available assurance capabilities.
The core of the paper builds on these concepts to propose a generic As4SimE framework that can encapsulate all the aspects necessary for the certification of a simulated environment that may be employed to demonstrate compliance against a specific set of regulatory requirements in an As4AI context, supporting the conduct of a set of selected operational scenarios. The primary outcome from this As4SimE activity is a Certified Simulated Environment (C-SimE) that can then be selected (from a list of C-SimEs) to form a MAS Assurance Plan (MAP), that through the conduct of supported scenarios, in associated C-SimEs, collectively enable a compliance demonstration activity for a specific autonomous system. This includes associated processes, tools, techniques, and curation of reference technical data and assurance reports.

20628,"Experimental flight test routinely manages risk within complex socio-technical systems. The flight test system already encompasses the crew, so the potential catastrophic consequences preclude typical mitigations of robustness and resilience. This leaves flight test professionals to manage risk using a framework of tools that is guided by cultural lore. 
Observation of the professional flight test community identified that their approach to managing risk in complex systems was unique. Yet with a few notable, tragic exceptions, their approach was clearly effective in circumstances that would otherwise be fatal.
Ethnographic research into this flight test risk management framework identified a combination of statistical and non-statistical tools in use, in parallel. They always had both at hand, though the flight test crews did not have knowledge of why different tools were effective. Their blanket approach assured effectiveness at the expense of efficiency. 
Research identified that there is no grand theory of risk and that risk management is grounded in economic theory. Examination of economic theory finds that Friedman's Utility Theory and Probability Theory are being read across, though the context is not being maintained. For complexity, alternative theory from Knight and Keynes is being used by the flight test community in their adoption of non-statistical approaches that accept uncertainty rather than assign a subjective probability.
Complicated systems respond to statistical approaches, though complexity denies these same tools. Complex systems require risk management approaches that accommodate emergence, dynamic configurations and non-deterministic system performance. An understanding of why the flight test risk management framework is effective provides a case study for the wider industry dealing with complex systems to emulate.  ",Identifying Effective Tools for Risk Management of Complex Systems,"Ben Luther 1, Indra Gunawan 2, Nam Nguyen 2, Nova Systems, Adelaide, SA, Australia, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia",
20639,"This paper covers recent work undertaken at Shoal to investigate and develop maturity metrics to increase understanding of the maturity of MBSE models that are built on Shoal and Shoal client projects. Maturity metrics are an important engineering tool that can collectively serve as a leading indicator for project performance. If a project is at a lower level of maturity heading into a major milestone than required there is a good chance of cost and schedule over-run, or quality deficiency. The paper commences with a review of the open literature that identified different methods to track model maturity. The information uncovered during the literature review is then synthesised into an MBSE model maturity assessment method that includes the ability to select MBSE model maturity metrics from a library. The work undertaken to generate a metrics library is presented and the paper concludes with some observations and lessons learned, as well as plans for further work. The approach presented could be used by organisations undertaking MBSE modelling to build their own library of metrics to measure the maturity of their MBSE models they are developed.

20640,"This paper presents a framework for managing and using the information associated with a system engineering workforce. The typical uses associated with information regarding an organisation’s systems engineering workforce can be grouped into strategic workforce management and tactical workforce management. Strategic workforce management covers the aggregate of people in the organisation whilst tactical workforce management is directly concerned with the individuals. Strategic workforce management makes decisions about the general areas to recruit, develop or subcontract to address the long-term capability needs for the positioning of the business. In contrast tactical workforce management makes decisions about who to allocate to projects or specific training courses, and supports considerations related to promotion. To make these decisions in a repeatable and reliable manner, processes need to be defined and use authoritative information covering the knowledge, competencies, and skills of people. The definition and use of that information is the subject of this paper.

20648,"Overview: Major infrastructure and transport projects require a systematic and structured approach to information management. Such projects typically entail documenting, controlling, and managing relationships between various levels of requirements and their associated design, and verification and validation activities. Handling such a significant volume of artefacts poses considerable challenges.
Context: Requirements management tools play an important role in capturing, organising, managing, and tracing requirements throughout the lifecycle of a system. These tools help manipulate and display data in tailored formats so that progress statuses and relationships can be easily visualised. One of the most common requirements management tools among systems engineering practitioners is the IBM Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (DOORS), and the IBM Report Builder offers a variety of options for generating metrics and reports.
Purpose: While pivotal for project analysis and decision-making, open-source information on report generation is scarce online. Only scattered information can be found on the internet across a few blogs, IBM documentation, and forum discussions. The paper aims at discussing differences in terms of handling and presenting data depending on the data source of the report.
Approach: The points of discussion of the paper are based on the lessons learnt over several years of systems engineering practice in Major Infrastructure and Transport Projects in Australia using DOORS Next Gen. It will present examples elucidating differences between the use of Data Warehouse (DW) and Lifecycle Query Engine (LQE).
Insights: In many cases, both data sources can meet the same reporting needs. However, key differences were observed in how long the data takes to update, the ability to add attributes, set filters and conditions to reports, and the ability to create custom expressions.

M&S assists developers and decision makers in a wide range of technical processes like analysis of alternatives, concept development, requirements evaluation, production and manufacturing, test and evaluation (T&E), integration, training, logistics, and risk management as well as in assessing the capability over the entire operational space. M&S will continue to grow as a critical component of an overall test program strategy. In this presentation we examine the current state of M&S in acquisition T&E, as viewed from the lens of a small number of acquisition programs, and provide some useful hints to advance and get the most of its application. Specifically, we provide a perspective on the role of M&S in the T&E strategy, the sufficiency of M&S processes, identify gaps in M&S verification and validation (V&V), report on methods used for assessing model maturity, and identify digital engineering strategies that could help improve M&S V&V over the lifecycle.

20684,"Australia faces complex global challenges that demand a resilient and integrated defence force capability. As these challenges continue to evolve and become more intricate by the day, it is imperative to simplify the processes involved in acquiring new capabilities. Additionally, it is vital to maintain the efficiency of the defence industry to strike a balance between capability acquisition and long-term sustainability. Moreover, modern systems are increasingly complex due to technological advancements, integration, and dynamic environments, posing challenges in understanding behaviour, predicting outcomes, and managing risks. 
Mission engineering (ME) provides a systematic approach to optimise system design, development, and operation, integrating technical, operational, and organisational aspects. Therefore, ME is crucial in accelerating capability development, extending its influence beyond defence to various sectors like health and manufacturing. It fosters innovation and efficiency in vital sectors, enhancing national resilience and competitiveness. Professionalising ME is vital for navigating these complexities, ensuring practitioners possess the skills and expertise to achieve desired outcomes effectively. Equipped with the skills to analyse evolving risks and develop innovative solutions, mission engineers ensure responsiveness to dynamic landscapes.  
UNSW Canberra introduced a stackable micro-credentials model in ME, comprising fundamental, intermediate, and advanced phases, which is a significant step towards professionalising the field in Australia. Co-designed with industry, this model not only demonstrates the gradual imparting of ME competency framework but also showcases the adaptability of ME competencies beyond defence, underscoring its relevance and importance. 
This presentation highlights UNSW Canberra's innovative strategy for addressing Australia's need for professionalised ME. Moreover, we demonstrate the model’s adaptability to different sectors' landscapes by tracing the evolution of ME concepts and competency frameworks across industry boundaries. Through this initiative, practitioners acquire the competence to navigate missions across various industries, signalling a new era of ME versatility with far-reaching implications in line with Australia’s needs.

20696,"In Australia there is no dedicated flight test range or facility available for civil UAS test and development. UAS operations are expanding and continue to demand focus from the regulators to safely blend UAS and manned aircraft activity. Currently every activity requires an application to CASA for approval to conduct the planned activity and each of these can take a protracted time which can delay the development cycle. As UAS become more present in the skies, there is the need to assess, test and evaluate larger and larger platforms safely. Whilst it may be possible to test small UAS of modest speed close to larger city centres, the testing of platforms over 150kg and that operate at higher speed or higher altitudes, need access to areas of ground and airspace where the risk can be managed.
This study provides a methodology that can be used to select an area to set up a flight test range.

By directly incorporating safety considerations and optimising system performance through the use of model-based- system safety (MBSS) processes, we can ensure safer, more efficient and reliable autonomous systems.
This study aims to identify challenges and opportunities in assuring the safety and cybersecurity of autonomous systems, proposing Model-Based Systems Safety (MBSS) as a promising framework to address these complexities effectively.
Through a comprehensive review of current safety processes, this paper identifies gaps exacerbated by disruptive technologies. Building upon model-based engineering principles, a framework for MBSS is formulated to systematically assess and mitigate safety risks in autonomous systems, emphasizing the seamless integration of MBSE and MBSS throughout the system lifecycle.
The adoption of MBSS offers a structured approach to enhance safety and cybersecurity assurance in autonomous technologies. This paper provides both theoretical insights and practical implications for industry stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers, highlighting the potential of MBSS to foster trust and reliability amidst technological disruption.
In conclusion, this paper underscores the pressing need for innovative strategies to navigate the intersection of disruptive technologies, system safety, and cybersecurity.

20707,"Models are central to understanding systems and to the engineering of systems. Systems engineers employ various types of models to communicate shared understanding, through system life-cycle models that enable the transformation of functional models to physical models, that are then realized as tangible systems of benefit to society. The recognition of the central nature of models to the engineering of systems resulted in the forming of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) wherein the essence of the system of interest is contained within a system model in contrast to traditional documents. However, the evolution of model-types employed, both to understand and to engineer systems, appears to largely have been a pragmatic activity driven by the needs of the numerous individual engineering and management subdisciplines. This paper briefly examines extant taxonomy of systems models used in the engineering of systems and in understanding operational systems and considers the question of whether there is a suitable system “meta-model” that naturally “contains” all types of systems models used therein. It explores this question through a systems-thinking lens, in conjunction with concepts on mental models from biology and philosophy.  This analysis gives rise to framework for systems models and to the proposition that all (systems) models take on one of two forms: as reference models that aid in the engineering of systems or as representative models that aid in understanding operational systems.   The paper concludes that it is possible to propose an emergent “model of systems models” that combines these two classes in an evolutionary way.  This construct is offered for consideration and refinement by the systems community.

20712,"Overview: In the Australian infrastructure sector, Systems Engineering (SE) is often practised in siloes, by systems engineers only. It is not well engrained in the organisational processes, and not actively championed nor driven by leaders and decision-makers. This results in a fragmented adoption of SE with reduced benefits; inefficiencies and cost overruns; or worse, projects not delivering the required outcomes.
Context: There is a significant mandate and guidance for the application of SE in the infrastructure sector. Transport for NSW Asset Management Framework [1] mandates the adoption of an SE approach for complex transport infrastructure systems over their life cycles. The UK Institute of Civil Engineers extensively documented how systems thinking can improve the delivery of complex infrastructure projects [2]. The Dutch Guidelines for Systems Engineering within the Civil Engineering Sector [3] provide clear guidance for the successful implementation of SE within the sector and organisations. The UK Government recently published documents promoting systems thinking for civil servants [4].

Approach:  This presentation will analyse and identify causes and solutions through:
i) A review of recent literature, articles and industry reports (assisted by AI when appropriate);
ii) Comparing approaches of the Australian infrastructure sector with other sectors and countries; and
iii) Interviews with thought leaders across the sector.

Context - In a global context, we will be moving towards model-based approaches, knowledge sharing will be exponentially increasing, digital technologies such as AI, autonomy and digital twinning will be incorporated into the various engineering disciplines as they better evolve to adjust to a dynamic world with increasing complexity. Collaborations and interactions will be paramount, largely through the management of the digital thread, enabled through the tools and environments of the digital ecosystem. To do this, the enterprise workforce will need to be diverse, agile, efficient, possibly distributed, and more strongly recognise knowledge as an asset. This level of transformation can be confusing, difficult to identify and even harder to implement. 
Purpose - To navigate a DT, guidance is required from behaviour adoption, technology evolutions, to new/tailored practices and tools, balancing the need to change with the constraints of the enterprise. This guidance must be tailorable to apply to different system projects. 
Approach - A combination of workshops, and industry experience across multiple domains and countries with real life examples are used to illustrate this topic. Many of the guidance points will resonate with participants whether in industry, academia or government, as we all undertake a DT at some level in our enterprises.

However, we often strive to deliver a perfect solution, sometimes warranted, sometimes not, potentially leading to cost and/or schedule overruns, and the introduction, or the appearance of poor quality systems at initial deployment. Adopting a Minimal Viable Capability (MVC) addresses this challenge, or does it? To understand the complexities for realising a successful MVC a number of interacting factors will be presented.
Context - A MVC approach supports the delivery of needed capability as soon as possible with further capabilities being incrementally incorporated. It is not however just about ""descoping a project"". MVC requires a lot of change and flexibility both in acquisition and sustainment. Development lifecycles, contracting models, operational scenarios, mission threads, agility, to name a few, all require to be modified under MVC.  These impacts are often not understood resulting in sub-optimum MVC deliveries.  
Purpose - To avoid/minimise the same problems preventing successful delivery of needed capability under a MVC, a holistic view must be taken. From this viewpoint, impacts of delivering MVC on development lifecycles, checkpoints, tailoring of practices, framework and tools, and technology evolutions must be addressed. Likewise, the importance of model-based engineering approaches increases. Underpinning these factors is being agile, particularly if speed to deployment is critical. This presentation provides the necessary guidance to deliver a MVC.
Approach - A combination of government-industry discussions, workshops, and industry experience with real life examples are used to illustrate this topic. The adaptations identified in this presentation can be readily applied to both the acquirer and supplier.

20732,"Research groups are challenged with ensuring that their activities are appropriately aligned to evolving strategic intent. This paper aims to address that challenge by describing a systematic approach, using Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques, to bridge the gap between strategic intent and exploratory research activities such as Modelling and Simulation, and experimental prototyping.
To demonstrate the approach, this paper presents a case study where a descriptive model was developed within CATIA Magic to:
capture the structure and activities of a research group;
link the elements of that groups research program with strategic intent; and,
trace the strategic intent to exploratory prototyping conducted by the research group.
Strategic intent was captured within a model as distinct statements (similar to a high-level capability or business requirement) and then explicitly linked to research activities, which were grouped under known research program elements. By doing so, a holistic view of the organisations research program was captured, identifying areas of research that were not necessarily aligned to the strategic intent, as well as areas of strategic intent that were not supported by research or technology development activities.
The model was then used to capture operational-level analysis and subsequent system need derivation. The intent of this was to provide a more robust trace from strategic intent through to technology development by allowing development efforts, such as producing prototype systems, to be driven by operational analysis. The results from gathered from experimentation could then be used to further refine system needs and inform future prototyping/development activities. In doing so, experimental prototyping was more aligned to operational analysis and hence strategic intent throughout the entire research program duration.

20761,"This presentation showcases the outcomes of the EcoPlex R&D project (https://www.ecoplex.fr/index_en.html), focusing on a novel methodological approach and software solution that integrates life cycle assessment (LCA) with systems architecture design. The EcoPlex project aimed to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the environmental impacts of systems throughout their entire lifecycle.By enriching system models with detailed information such as component life expectancy, material usage, consumption rates, and emissions, it becomes possible to generate a comprehensive inventory of the environmental flows associated with the system. This inventory is then processed by LCA software to analyze and identify the system's ecological impacts from raw material extraction to end-of-life. Integrating system models with LCA analysis not only saves time by eliminating redundant data entry but also enables the rapid identification of components with the most significant ecological impacts, thanks to the fact that the data in the LCA tool follows the component structure of the system model. This facilitates quick modifications to the architecture model, promoting an iterative process for environmental optimization early in the development of the system.The presentation will illustrate these concepts and processes using a case study in the naval domain, specifically focusing on the Mobula 8 and Mobula 10 boats, which are designed to collect plastic waste from the oceans. We will demonstrate the application of the Ecodesign for Capella add-on and its integration with OpenLCA, an open-source LCA software, to highlight the practical benefits and efficiency of this integrated approach.",Early Evaluation of Environmental Impacts by Coupling Architecture Models with LCA Tools,"Stephane Lacrampe 1, Obeo, Comox, BC, Canada",
20762,"In complex systems engineering projects, solving the right problem is imperative to ensure that the solution addresses the root cause rather than treat the symptoms, which often result in the creation of technical debt. By focussing on the right problem, we can develop solutions that are effective, efficient and resilient in the long run, resulting in a sustainable solution, thereby creating opportunity for innovation. Project technical problems are not independent of each other and are often masked by inter-related technical issues making the identification of the right problem highly challenging. In this paper, we explore how we can identify the right problem for a specific project phase and scenario by asking the right questions leading to root cause identification. We also emphasise the importance of event-driven approach in the validation of engineering progress by gathering and analysing relevant data as well as continuous implementation of lessons learnt to minimise the risk of technical debt.",Beyond Solving the problem right – Solving the right problem,"Varun Prakash 1, Nam Huynh 1, Jacobs CMS, Melbourne",

20776,"Overview
The Rail industry is shifting towards a Systems Engineering oriented approach for major projects. This new way of delivering projects comes with challenges that the industry needs to overcome in order to achieve the benefits of this change.
Context
The past century has seen a significant increase of Rail Projects throughout Australia. Over the years, the evolution of the environment in and around major cities as well as in rural areas has introduced new levels of complexity for the design and delivery of Rail Projects.
In this context, State Governments have started to shift their approach and mandate Systems Engineering to be applied on the most recent Rail Projects.
Purpose
For an industry historically adopting a Design and Construct approach, what does this mean? What are the benefits, but also the challenges of this shift?
Approach
This presentation gives an overview of the legacy Design and Construct approach and proposes a definition of SESA, as well as an overview of what this includes and where it applies in the lifecycle of a project. Drawing on data from projects in other industries where Systems Engineering methodologies have been applied for decades, we present the benefits and assess the relevance of Systems Engineering to the Rail Industry.
Insights
Based on observations from recent rail projects in Australia, we identify some of the challenges faced by multi-disciplinary teams to implement Systems Engineering, focusing on some differences between adding Systems Engineering on a project versus embedding Systems Engineering in the framework of the project.
We discuss some aspects to consider when it comes to implementing better embedded Systems Engineering on projects, ultimately aiming at delivering projects through a Fully Integrated Systems Engineering process to see improvements in the delivery outcomes, including quality, costs, conformance to contractual requirements and client satisfaction.

20808,"Research groups are challenged with ensuring that their activities are appropriately aligned to evolving strategic intent. This paper aims to address that challenge by describing a systematic approach, using Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques, to bridge the gap between strategic intent and exploratory research activities such as Modelling and Simulation, and experimental prototyping.
As strategic intent evolves, so too should the research activities. However, it is often the case that as strategic intent evolves, areas of research become unaligned. Further, there exists updated strategic intent that is not supported by research or technology development activities.
To maintain alignment with strategic intent, this paper proposes an approach leveraging model-based systems engineering (MBSE) techniques.
To demonstrate the approach, this paper presents a case study where a descriptive model was developed within CATIA Magic to:
capture the structure and activities of a research group;
link the elements of that groups research program with strategic intent; and,
trace the strategic intent to exploratory prototyping conducted by the research group.
The model was then used to capture operational-level analysis and subsequent system need derivation. The intent of this was to provide a more robust trace from strategic intent through to technology development by allowing development efforts, such as producing prototype systems, to be driven by operational analysis.
The results from gathered from experimentation could then be used to further refine system needs and inform future prototyping/development activities. In doing so, experimental prototyping was more aligned to operational analysis and hence strategic intent throughout the entire research program duration.

20872,"Systems Engineering disciplines and tooling have been successfully adopted by many other sectors that work with highly complex systems. By comparison, their application in the electric power sector has been negligible. Here we explore how MBSE can support the analysis, rationalisation and evolution of the massively complex architecture inherent in Australia’s largest legacy GW-scale power system as it transforms.
GW-scale power systems are some of the largest and most complex systems ever created by humans. Global progress toward deep decarbonisation of legacy grids presents significant challenges as traditional sources of generation are withdrawn and new highly variable, weather-dependent, locationally dispersed, numerically large, and non-merchant resources take their place.
In this transformational context, the purpose of this work was to explore MBSE’s potential to:
Provide tooling that enables the decomposition and ‘taming’ of the massive complexity inherent to transforming legacy GW-scale power systems;
Empower more informed, multi-stakeholder participation by making critical content explicit and tractable which would otherwise remain opaque and intractable; and,
Increase decision quality, timeliness and traceability to increase the potential for full benefits-realisation and avoiding the propagation of unintended consequences.
A key focus of the work was modelling the underlying as-built architecture of Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) power system, potential transitionary and plausible future ‘step change’ architecture that accommodates the cyber- and physics-based realities of deeply integrating millions of diverse energy resources to become an integral part of a 21st century power system.  Given limited precedence in applying MBSE to power systems, an important first step was the model configuration including a taxonomy of logical interface types.

20878,"Our minds solve problems by applying frameworks of ideas, concepts and methods to areas of interest.  Clearly defined situations allow the re-use of themes and structured methods to progressively decompose, analyse, define and integrate systems as solutions.   Systems engineering as a methodology is a structured framework typified by the familiar ‘V’ lifecycle.  However, socio-technical situations are complicated by unpredictable human responses, conflicting objectives, interdependencies and perceptions.  These soft or wicked problems can be difficult to resolve without an understanding of the problem situation and viable improvements that may not be limited to a technical solution.
Soft systems thinking methodologies evolved to encourage a holistic approach to exploring unstructured, complex problems and improve the integration of technology in society.  Examples include ETHICS (Mumford), Multiview (Avison and Wood-Harper) and Soft Systems Methodology (Checkland).  An early version of the latter is a seven-stage model, and SSM has evolved into a framework for exploration based on interacting logical and cultural streams of analysis.  Irrespective of Checkland’s observation that only neophytes apply SSM as a seven-stage process it does provide a mosaic of activities suited to exploring the interplay between society and systems.
This presentation describes the application of Soft Systems Methodology to understand complex socio-technical problem situations and identify improvements.  In the spirit of Checkland’s action research approach the presentation uses research into a Marine Safety System to illustrate SSM in a real-world environment.  Excursions into other methodologies including Information Systems Methodology (Wilson) and Socio-Technical Stages of Growth (Galliers) are introduced to illustrate the derivation of socio-technical requirements from the problem situation analysis.  The findings are used to summarise the benefits of a soft systems thinking approach to understanding the problem situation and viable improvements alongside a structured system-based methodology, proposing another layer to the ‘V’ lifecycle.

20881,"Overview: This paper introduces the STRATA model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology, emphasizing its key aspects and unique advantages in verification, validation, test, and evaluation domains. Attendees will gain insights into its applicability and advantages in complex modeling scenarios.
Context: Navigating the initial stages of MBSE model formulation in any tool can be challenging, particularly within collaborative teams. Implementing a methodology offers a structured roadmap, enhancing model organization, usability, and collaboration. The STRATA methodology addresses these challenges, and combined with its model validation rulesets, provides the user feedback on model consistency and completeness.
Purpose: The STRATA methodology is structured in terms of defined levels or layers of the system architecture (the rows) and systems engineering, program management, and specialty engineering concept groups (the columns) affords.. The research aims to elucidate the benefits of adopting the STRATA methodology, particularly in the context of verification and validation. By defining clear model objectives and scope, the STRATA framework allows a modeling team to model what they know regardless of where it fits in the matrix.  This supports the early involvement of test and evaluation teams in the requirements refinement and systems architecture definition processes. We will show how the STRATA methodology supports multiple engineering design scenarios.
Approach: Utilizing the GENSYS MBSE tool, the paper demonstrates the practical implementation of STRATA through a representative problem. A comparison of the V&V concepts available in the Comprehensive Systems Design Language (CSDL), the natural language metamodel supporting STRATA, will be reviewed and compared to those provided in SysML v1 and v2.  Interoperability of the languages will also be discussed.

20894,"The interpretation of imagery produced by autonomous underwater vehicle side scanning sonar system used for locating anti-shipping mines is a crucial operation for naval safety. Deep learning algorithms have shown potential to identify mine like objects within sonar imagery at a rapid pace with consistent results and with minimal human operator interaction. Traditional methods involved the technical operator manually scanning through a large dataset of sonar imagery. Increasingly, the Navy are looking to employ autonomous underwater vehicles fitted with side scanning sonar to perform remote sensing in the search for mines. The fact that side scanning sonar imagery is not available for inspection by the operators until after the mission has concluded and the vehicle has returned, add to onerous nature of this task. The purpose of this exercise was to perform a binary classification task to classify images as either containing a mine like object or not. Are deep learning algorithms more efficient at analysing sonar images and what are the limitations facing these algorithms now. The Convolution Neural Network model would be trained using sonar images that either contain a mine like object or none, the model would then be evaluated on its ability to classify images with mine like objects within a separate dataset. The results were then compared with a real-world operator attempting to manually complete the same task. Within the scope of testing conducted, the Convolution Neural Network tended to be more liberal in its classifications, as it displayed a higher false positive rate in comparison to the human classifier. Overall, the Convolution Neural Network showed good potential for operational use. Predictably, the performance of the Convolution Neural Network appeared to improve as the quality and quantity of training images increased.

20895,"This paper explores innovative testing methodologies tailored for complex software and cyber-physical systems in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) environments for search and rescue operations. By integrating model and simulation based testing with virtualisation, we develop scalable testing frameworks customised to HADR application requirements. Virtualisation enables simulation of scenarios, facilitating thorough testing without operational disruptions.
 
A key focus is on the comprehensive evaluation of Systems of Systems (SoS) behavior to identify integration issues and performance bottlenecks early in the development lifecycle. Simulated interactions between system components reveal vulnerabilities, consequently enhancing system reliability and resilience.
 
Our approach emphasises continuous testing and validation throughout the system lifecycle. Leveraging digital twins and cyber-physical models, we ensure adaptability to evolving requirements and operational conditions. This iterative process enhances system robustness and responsiveness to dynamic HADR environments for search and rescue operations.
 
This approach, employed in testing the lifecycle of complex software and cyber-physical systems, aims to generate reliable test cases, ensure systems adapt to changes observed in prior tests and uphold mission resilience by prioritising performance. It involves creating a surrogate model of a search and rescue mission, identifying failure modes to use as test cases and evaluating them through sensitivity analysis. The final sequence of test cases, relying on more expensive testing, is prioritised based on its impact on the search and rescue mission surrogate model.

Concepts and principles from systems thinking, modelling and simulation and situation awareness are summarised, being building blocks for best practice into evolutionary SE life-cycle processes. It is recognised that AI projects need their own methodology that is different to that used in software only projects. The data used to train models is a fundamental component of the system itself. There are several Life Cycle models currently used in Data Science projects. These Data Science life-cycle models will be mapped to the Systems Engineering approach.

21004,"Digital engineering (DE) is an active area of research in systems engineering. This paper explores the application of digital engineering to complex, large-scale energy decarbonisation projects. Energy decarbonisation projects are highly diverse in nature, spanning multiple industries, such as: energy generation, transportation, and mining. A DE approach that combines systems engineering design and analysis, supported by physics-based modelling, can be used to effectively understand, design, and deliver these often complex projects. However, such an approach can quickly become highly resource intensive. The paper addresses this issue though a flexible yet cost effective approach that utilises a modular combination of model-based systems engineering, physics-based modelling, and operations analysis techniques to analyse a range of energy decarbonisation projects. Furthermore, many energy decarbonisation projects are enterprise activities with a range of critical externally controlled elements or effectively function as a strategic alliance with significant independence in the development of the component systems. The paper describes how lessons from defence mission engineering can be used to address these system-of-systems aspects and shape the modular DE approach. Finally, the paper outlines some examples from the mining industry of applying this modular digital engineering approach.

21060,"Overview: In this presentation, we present a reference architecture for Australia's multi-energy, water, and hydrogen systems.  For the first time, we begin to understand the inherent interdependencies between these systems using model-baseed systems engineering.  
Context: Australia has one of the greatest solar and wind energy resources in the world.  And yet, it is one of the largest exporters of carbon-intensive energy sources.  In the meantime, its arid, sub-tropical climate leaves it water scarce and vulnerable to extreme weather events. 
Purpose: As Australia proceeds with its own sustainable energy transformation, it must reconcile these realities so that energy services are sustainable, affordable, resilient, and equitable.  The interdependencies between is multi-energy, water, and hydrogen systems can create opportunitistic synergies and inevitable trade-offs.  
Approach:  This presentation exposits a reference architecture as a means of managing the complexity of Australia’s Nexus Infrastructure of Energy, Water and Hydrogen (ANIEWH).  It argues that Australia must adopt an integrated approach to infrastructure systems engineering that explicitly tackles the coupling of energy, water, and hydrogen.  It further argues that a model-based systems engineering reference architecture provides the disciplinary means by which to tackle this inherent complexity.
Insights:  The Hydrogen-Energy-Water Reference Architecture (HEWRA) is then presented in terms of system boundary, form, and function for the coal, oil, natural gas, electric power, hydrogen, potable water, and wastewater management sectors.   The presentation concludes with thoughts on how this work can be further advanced within future initiatives.   ","Taming the Complexity in Australia’s Nexus Infrastructure of Energy, Water, and Hydrogen:  A Reference Architecture","Amro Farid 1, CSIRO Smart Energy Mission, Lyme, NEW HAMPSHIRE, United States",
21061,"Overview:  This presentation uses hetero-functional graph theory to understand the asset-level resilience and national level sustainability of the American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES)
Context:  The challenge of global climate change necessitates a fundamental and holistic re-design of the AMES.  Traditionally, the electric grid, natural gas, oil, and coal systems have been studied individually.  More recent efforts have tried to study pairs of these systems but for a number of theoretical and practical reasons such efforts have fallen short of combining these four systems into an integrated model.
Purpose:  The ""American Multi-Modal Energy System Synthetic and Simulated Data (AMES-3D)"" project funded by the (American) National Science Foundation seeks to fill this gap and produce an open-source, physically-informed, machine-learning, structural and behavioral model of the AMES for potential use and expansion by the broader scientific community.  This presentation seeks to introduce the audience to the AMES' data, model and development in several steps.
Approach:  Hetero-functional graph theory is briefly introduced as the scientific basis for producing structural and behavioral models where an arbitrary number of infrastructure networks of arbitrary topology are connected arbitrarily.
Insights:  We briefly compare the network statistics and resilience measures of the (traditional) formal and hetero-functional graphs of the American electric power system.   Such a comparison motivates the use of hetero-functional graphs in systems with multiple energy carriers and facilities with fundamentally heterogeneous function.  In particular, we show how such systems require 3D degree distributions that differentiate the processes and energy carriers in a hetero-functional graph.   Finally, we demonstrate how such 3D degree distributions in the states of New York, California, Texas, and the entire United States differ as a result of their fundamentally different geographies and policies.

21062,"Overview:  This presentation develops a hetero-functional graph state estimator of the American Multi-Modal Energy System
Context:  As one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, global climate change demands a host of changes across at least four critical energy infrastructures: the electric grid, the natural gas system, the oil system, and the coal system.  In the context of the United States,  this paper refers to this system-of-systems as ``The American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES)"".
Purpose:  These combined changes necessitate an understanding of the AMES interdependencies both structurally and behaviorally to develop and enact effective policies.
Approach:  This work focuses on behavioral analysis methods to provide examples of how to analyze system behavior and the crucial flows of energy through the system.  Building upon past works, the AMES is modeled and its behavior is analyzed using Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT).  Specifically, the work presents a state estimation model of the AMES.
Insights:  This work brings the state estimation analysis out of the single-operand electric grid environment and into the heterogeneous environment that is the AMES.  Employing a data-driven and model-based systems engineering approach in combination with HFGT a Hetero-functional Graph State Estimation optimization program was developed to optimize the flows of mass and energy through the AMES.  This provides the first example of using a state estimator with HFGT to model the flows of mass and energy across multiple energy systems contained within the AMES.",Developing a Hetero-functional Graph State Estimator of the American Multi-Modal Energy System,"Amro Farid 1, CSIRO Smart Energy Mission, Lyme, NEW HAMPSHIRE, United States",

21069,"This case study outlines a master's-level course in Systems Engineering. The course focuses on learning about model-based decision support frameworks and tools under conditions of deep uncertainty. Designed to equip students with essential tools for strategic decision-making in novel and uncertain situations, the course targets individuals interested in addressing decision problems within contexts of deep uncertainty. It utilizes a System Dynamics (SD) workforce simulation model, developed from a real-life case study, alongside the Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA) Workbench. The course structure emphasizes the development of students' abilities to formulate decision problems and analyse outcomes to infer decision-making insights in the face of complexity and uncertainty. 
Delivering the course during Semester 2, 2022 and 2023 for a diverse student cohort in terms of age, discipline (such as engineering and business backgrounds), and technical backgrounds, allowed us to identify several aspects that succeeded and the reasons behind their success. These aspects include blended teaching, real-life case studies, power of modern technology, and interactive activities. Likewise, we identified several challenges and the underlying reasons. These challenges include a little overwhelming course content and lack of consideration of diversity of student cohort at the first iteration in 2022. While it was both interesting and challenging to deliver this course for the diverse student cohort, it was also a rewarding experience for both participants and course staff.
The study reveals that students' grasp of complexity and uncertainty within decision contexts has advanced significantly through practical exposure and real-life case study involvement. Additionally, practical exposure provides students with a valuable opportunity to immerse themselves in the intricacies of the problem at hand.

21076,"The Defence Strategic Review (DSR) highlights the need for effective Mission Engineering (ME) to develop capabilities that meet specific mission objectives efficiently and cost-effectively. For ME to be effective, adaptable systems need to be developed that can address a wide range of evolving problems and meet specific mission requirements. Such systems must be versatile and broad, remaining relevant across various scenarios and precise needs. This demands significant foresight and ingenuity in the design stages, where architects must anticipate future challenges and opportunities, embedding both flexibility and specificity into the system. Mission-aware systems offer a solution to this challenge by integrating mission goals directly into their architecture and development lifecycle, ensuring technical soundness and alignment with future mission requirements. This alignment is crucial in contexts where strategic planning and execution are essential, synchronizing technological and human capabilities for mission success. By aligning systems engineering efforts, which focus on technical development, with mission engineering, which emphasizes overall mission success, organizations can ensure that their technological solutions support strategic objectives. This paper proposes an approach for designing mission-aware systems by integrating ME with Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). The integration occurs in two stages: first, by introducing missions as an intermediary that influences system capabilities alongside operational capabilities through a structural causal model; and second, by mapping ME frameworks, such as the DoD ME guide, with systems architecting frameworks, such as the DoDAF or MoDAF, to create a unified profile. This unified profile is used to describe and document ME artefacts within the MBSE model, ensuring that mission requirements are integrated into the system design from the outset. This approach, also, provides a common language between ME and MBSE, producing mission-compatible products that facilitate mission guided system design and evaluation.   ",Designing Mission-Aware Systems through ME and MBSE Integration,"Ebrahim Aly 1 2, Julian Reck 3, Sondoss Elsawah 1 2, Capability Systems Centre, UNSW, Canberra, Australia, School of Systems and Computing, UNSW, Canberra, Australia,, Raytheon , Adelaide , SA, Australia",
21081,"Overview - SA Water identified the implementation of Systems Engineering (SE) as a key opportunity for process improvement, and engaged Aurecon to create a tailored methodology for the delivery of capital projects.  
Context - SA Water began reviewing the feasibility of implementing SE in 2021. This review identified that project delivery was siloed, with limited information flows and reliant on the knowledge of senior personnel to progress. As a result, projects suffered from scope creep or late changes, subsequent cost variations, and a lack of traceability to the original project aims and needs.
Purpose - SA Water asked Aurecon to apply their SE knowledge to review existing processes for investigating high-level concept solutions; ensure that project selection is evidence-based; investigate options that consider and address all stakeholder needs; respect inputs from all stages of the project lifecycle; and enable data-driven decision-making.
Approach - Aurecon conducted interviews and workshops with representatives from all teams and levels throughout SA Water to consolidate a list of issues experienced when delivering projects. From this, a bespoke SE approach was tailored to the organisational level of understanding to ‘meet people where they are’ - introducing concepts that would deliver maximum value for limited effort, rather than just directing people to the SE body of knowledge.
It started small, with a reduced set of activities to help the realisation of project needs, developing these into verifiable requirements for the project to meet, and managing interfaces and stakeholder expectations across the developing network.
This has grown over the course of the engagement into a fully-fledged V-model, providing customised guidance and tailored approaches for SA Water.

21090,"Overview
Novel aircraft and their systems have largely been developed with systems engineering practices that have had to be adapted to account for their novel nature. However, the last 12 months has seen the publication of updated guideline for aerospace systems engineering that may go some way to amend this issue. Namely; ARP4754B, ARP4761A and the INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook. This presentation shares an industry-focussed analysis on the implications on these updates for complex and novel system-of-systems.
Context
The aerospace industry is well known to rely heavily on prescriptive certification standards to ensure airworthiness, and whilst systems engineering guidelines are not required, they are referenced significantly as an acceptable means of compliance, especially as evidence for design assurance. The advent of novel technologies such as hydrogen, batteries, UAVs and eVTOLs has led to a significant shift in the way airworthiness is being approached.
Purpose
The purpose is to analyse ongoing industry projects, a hydrogen fuel-cell powered aircraft and specialist-use manned eVTOL system and how the adoption of these guidelines may have impacted them from a systems engineering perspective. One area that is of interest in particular is the promotion of MBSE within ARP4754A and how this affects novel aircraft development.
Approach
The implications will be analysed in the context of 3 novel applications and the first-hand experience gained in their development. This evidence will be presented against a theoretical application of these standards against these completed projects and how this may impact future novel applications in aerospace contexts.

21102,"Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is rapidly gaining popularity across various industries due to its effectiveness in managing complex systems. Its utility is well recognized by researchers and systems engineering (SE) practitioners alike, who acknowledge its potential to streamline processes, improve accuracy, and enhance collaboration. Despite its recognized benefits, the adoption of MBSE still faces several challenges. Research has identified several challenges related to the adoption of MBSE, categorizing them into knowledge-based, tool-based, cultural and political, cost-related, and stakeholder understanding and acceptance-related challenges. Among these, knowledge-based and tool-based challenges are deemed the most critical. These challenges, particularly the knowledge related one, are closely linked to deficient coursework and training programs for MBSE. This highlights the pressing need for structured and robust MBSE curriculum that can adequately address these key barriers to MBSE adoption and ensure its successful integration into industry practices. To effectively address the disconnect between training programs and industry demands in MBSE, it is essential to thoroughly tackle the key components affecting the workforce readiness such as skills, competencies, and training levels. Additionally, these components should not be considered in isolation; rather, they should be viewed as an interconnected network where each element influences the others. This work proposes a framework that delineates these relationships and utilize it create a cohesive and comprehensive MBSE curriculum. By clearly defining the specific skills and competencies necessary for different roles in the MBSE ecosystem and matching them with corresponding training levels, the framework ensures a systematic and coordinated educational approach. The curriculum is applied for an MBSE professional education program delivered at UNSW Canberra. By incorporating the framework’s principles, the curriculum aims to equip students with the necessary skills and competencies to effectively apply MBSE, thereby addressing the key challenges in MBSE adoption and enhancing workforce readiness.  ",Industry-Focused MBSE Curriculum: Role-Specific Capabilities to Meet Industry Needs ,"Ebrahim Aly 1 2, Emiliya Suprun 1 2, Sondoss Elsawah 1 2, Capability Systems Centre, UNSW, Canberra, Australia, School of Systems and Computing, UNSW, Canberra, Australia",
21104,"Key to the effective employment of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is the ability to effectively communicate the rich information contained in the model to stakeholders. This paper provides insights and examples for effective reporting of digital Mission Engineering models, drawing on lessons learned from similar approaches.
Mission Engineering is the application of formal approaches to plan, analyse, organise, and integrate current and emerging system/operational capabilities to achieve desired effects. It is used to examine missions for several purposes, including identification of capability gaps, needs and solutions.
Mission Engineering practitioners will define missions, timeframes and capability states to examine, then model functional and physical architectures to provide structural and behavioural representations to facilitate mission analyses.
The Unified Architectural Framework (UAF) provides a standardised enterprise architecture framework, is being adopted by the United States Department of Defense, and has been demonstrated as an effective, consistent, and standardised means for the digital engineering implementation of Mission Engineering.
The Whole of Systems Analytical Framework (WSAF) provides a digital engineering approach to Capability Design within the Australian Defence context. There is significant cross-over between the application of WSAF and the Mission Engineering process, and the lessons learnt from its application can be applied to the adoption of Mission Engineering.
A key component of WSAF is a suite of report generating tools, that supplements the MBSE environment, enabling the modelled information to be consistently reported and presented in a form readily understood by decision makers (i.e. Capability Definition Document).
This paper examines the reporting principles employed on WSAF, how these can be applied in the Mission Engineering context, and demonstrate the adaption of these principles in reporting UAF-based Mission Engineering architectures and analyses.

The Design and Analysis of Experiments is a structured process to identify the metrics, factors, and levels that most directly affect operational effectiveness and suitability of a system. The discipline embraces black box techniques that empowers practitioners to develop test matrices for systems of systems through the application of scientific techniques, and then build empirical models that quantitatively characterises the relationship between mission or system inputs and outputs. These empirical relationships can then be used as the basis for mission simulations.

21169,"The Energy System is immensely complex. Many actors participate in the Energy System performing a varied taxonomy of roles. Many of these actors are not engineers, let alone systems engineers, but have significant gravitas and influence over the Energy System and, consequentially, our journey to Net Zero.
In recent decades, much of the development of the Energy System has been achieved through an incremental approach following established industry methods and practices. The adoption of contemporary systems engineering methods has, perhaps, been slower than in other industrial and innovation areas.
Making robust decisions and changes is dependent upon having the best possible knowledge of the subject system. In the case of the Energy System, it is difficult enough to gain consensus on where the boundary of that system lies, let alone gather and present the structure, information and interdependence of the that system in a logical, repeatable and most importantly, usable way.
MBSE presents itself as a potential discipline that is capable of achieving these objectives. Initial attempts at using MBSE to develop a model representing the Energy System have, however, proven to be difficult. The number of different diagrams and relationship types that can be utilised in MBSE modelling is off putting to none MBSE users and they quickly lose interest. Users want to be able to see the information, not learn a modelling language.
A solution we propose is to hugely simplify the MBSE modelling diagrams, relationships and modelling techniques for the vast majority of users, creating a ‘general’ model of the Energy System that can be repeatably expanded and be used by all for analysis, research and insight. This ‘general’ model can then be used as a baseline for more detailed and bespoke modelling using the full power of MBSE on an as needs basis.

By 2050 the European Union aims to become the first carbon-neutral continent. By 2030, the EU wants to reduce CO2 emissions by 55%. To hit these targets, Germany and The Netherlands need rapid electrification, in industry, mobility and households. The share of electricity in the energy system will grow exponentially, from 20% today to 40-60% in 2050. As one of Europe’s largest Transmission Service Operators (TSOs), TenneT needs to develop a grid that can support society’s climate ambitions: they call this their 2045 Target Grid.
Therefore, several offshore wind energy areas have been designated to generate more sustainable energy. These need to be connected to the national grid and thus the 2GW Program was launched.
To make the 2GW program successful TenneT decided it needed standardisation, scalability and optimisation; they wanted to ensure each of the 17 project’s experiences benefited the next.

Chiller plants in buildings consume the greatest electrical power in Air-conditioning system, playing a pivotal role in our journey towards carbon neutrality. Chiller plants have conventionally been controlled using traditional rule-based strategies, resulting in energy inefficiency and limiting system adaptability to environmental changes. This paper reveals the success of implementing Artificial Intelligence-based model for large-scale real-time monitoring and control of chiller plant which seizes every opportunity to enhance building energy performance.
Context
With the introduction of modern high-efficiency chillers and a central Regional Digital Control Centre, there is an opportunity to implement control strategies to achieve energy saving by varying Coefficient of Performance under different part-load and ambient weather conditions. To acquire optimized chiller parameters, there were past trials using Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), or combination of both in achieving optimisation of engineering systems.
Purpose
This study aims to develop a scalable system, code-named ‘ChillStream’, based on the novelty in Artificial Intelligence (AI) chiller optimisation. Artificial Neural Networks were trained using historical plant data and weather data to predict power consumption and cooling load for individual chillers. In an attempt to combine the merits of evolutionary algorithm and swarm intelligence, a hybrid GA-PSO Algorithm was developed to calculate optimised setpoints at regular time intervals.
Approach
The developed AI control strategy was successfully deployed in a chiller plant with a significant cooling capacity installed in a clinical laboratory building in Hong Kong. Compared to the conventional rule-based system control, the chiller plant’s overall energy consumption was prominently reduced by 8% in autumn/winter 2023.
Insights
Through the autonomy of ChillStream to operate the chiller plant, considerable manpower resources are saved. This optimisation control strategy can be readily replicated and adjusted to accommodate the unique configurations of chiller plants in various buildings, resulting in substantial energy savings.",Scalable AI-Based Chiller Optimization System for Enhanced Energy Performance,"Vincent WL CHIU 1, Tommy KC LAM 1, Ray WH LAM 1, Safiya WK YU 1, Charlie CH LO 1, Jenny TY IP 1, Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, Hong Kong",

21199,"Overview: With emerging customer trends toward rapid product development programs, and strategic capability accelerators, the traditional 'above-the-line' (ATL) to 'below-the-line' (BTL) systems engineering divide is eroding. Blurring of these lines has heightened the need for primes to understand mission engineering principles, and achieve better horizontal and vertical information integration such that confidence in the mission-product fit can be developed, assessed and evolved with pace.
Context: Mission Engineering has traditionally been the purview of ‘above-the-line’ (ATL) systems engineering efforts, undertaken by a customer in eliciting their internal mission and operational needs. The mapping of specific missions and capability needs to new platforms, requires bridging of the operational and system lenses, which is beyond the scope of any one method or architecture framework.  
Purpose: Developing a proactive understanding of the customers intended missions and concept of operations, via mission engineering, and achieving traceability from mission needs through to design is deemed a critical enabler for effective product development activities. Model-based systems engineering was proposed to help bridge this divide and provide a pattern for multi-project/program research and development.
Approach: Modelling and architectural themes across mission engineering, operational/service modelling and object-oriented systems modelling were analysed and mapped to derive a holistic metamodel, methodology and viewpoint set. The resultant method was applied to an internal product development program as a case study and means of validation.
Insights: The investment in proactive mission engineering and alignment is feasible and effective, albeit expensive and assumption driven. Clear articulation of missions, capability needs and customer investment priorities would provide a more robust basis for ‘proactive’ mission engineering and allow industry to deliver a more competitive set of products and capabilities. Mission modelling holds greatest value when used as the basis of program/portfolio approach of research and development, thus allowing for re-use of the mission modelling investment.

21203,"Overview: The current and emerging defence environment has placed heightened emphasis on the need to rapidly develop mission-fit products across land, maritime and air domains. This presentation provides an introduction to novel model-based systems engineering methodologies (MBSE) established and actively utilised at BAE Systems Australia.
Context: It is well established that the development of certifiable, software intensive, systems must balance the rigour and traceability of conventional systems engineering (SE) programs with the demands of an agile and rapidly evolving product development program. This tension of delivering minimal viable capability and first-of-type systems at pace to validate customer need, whilst maintaining sufficient rigour to facilitate future certification and mitigate accretion of technical debt, is a difficult technical and programmatic challenge to navigate. 
Purpose: Blended MBSE methods adapting principles from above-the-line architecture frameworks and mission engineering concepts, object-oriented SE methods, and evolutionary lifecycle development models, was hypothesised to provide an optimal SE framework for such programs. Secondary aims included methods to support programmatic product development, product line management and variant management.
Approach: A bespoke MBSE approach, encompassing training, processes and tool customisation, was derived, trialled and refined across a range of product development projects.
Insights: It has been determined that prioritisation of several key SE drivers and core modelling viewpoints (at various stages of product maturity) provide a robust yet adaptable framework for system development. A summary of the problem drivers, key learnings and an introduction to the ‘meta-method’ used in the derivation of this approach will be provided.

21205,"Abstract Body 
This paper addresses key findings of the Productivity Commission report into Infrastructure investment 2014 and related reports that an estimated $30Bn pa of public money is wasted in the delivery of Infrastructure in Australia due primarily to failures of the Project Governance system used in delivery of project for outcomes. The Infrastructure Australia Plan (20160 also addresses the performance requirements of Governance and the need to refocus project deliverables on socially needed outcomes.
For emphasis of the problem facing Engineering leaders if a private sector client had a $30bn pa revenues shortfall due to poor investment decisions then a major investment would be immediately called up to fix the issue. For Public sector Engineering leaders, the question needs to be asked of Engineers how much investment in better governance is immediately needed to make the shortfall available for unfunded investments.
The paper outlines the reason for this shortfall and the ways that Assured Governance can avoid this annual loss in performance.
Systems for Public Sector Governance, how they work in practice and how they can be verified or audited under a Quality assurance framework or gateway review process are explained and proposals for improvement offered.
In addition, the erosion of value or wasted return on investment (ROI) and the transfer of benefits to the Project Delivery team of designers, contractors and suppliers is examined. System design and test and inspection plans (T&IP) for resilience audit are proposed and a Governance Maturity Model is provided to support intervention for poor Governance and to enable transformative Governance.

21207,"Rail transportation plays a pivotal role in facilitating economic growth and enhancing mobility; however, rail projects are often large and complex, requiring systems engineering and safety assurance (SESA) inputs. This paper explores how digital solutions can support and enhance traditional SESA frameworks.
Traditionally, SESA tasks involve structured but sometimes time-consuming approaches for identifying stakeholder needs, defining system requirements, and integrating subsystems to achieve project objectives.
While existing SESA frameworks provide a solid foundation for managing rail infrastructure projects, the use of digital engineering tools to solve the unique complexities of such projects are allowing SESA works to be completed more effectively and efficiently.
Through the integration of Revizto on some NSW and Victorian rail projects, the SESA team along with the digital engineering team, were able to run safety in design workshops more effectively and efficiently by allowing participants to have accurate depictions of equipment locations and to see the exact location of hazards through the creation of tags.
There are potential advances that can be made by integrating model-based systems engineering, architecting tools, requirements management tools, digital design simulation and modelling tools to further automate and streamline SESA tasks such as safety in design workshops, inter-disciplinary workshops, systems architecture, safety arguments, requirements management and development of assurance case reports.

21209,"Systems Engineers devote significant time to requirements management, which can detract attention from the valuable activity of requirements analysis. The issue stems from repetitive data exchange activity which requires systems engineers familiar with using requirements management tools such as IBM’s DOORS NG to produce exports of requirements into excel for discipline engineers to action. This often results in reporting of stale data, and misinformation when managing requirements using spreadsheets.
In order to solve this problem KBR looked at ways of digitally transforming the way discipline engineers interact with requirements managed by systems engineers. Learning to use specialist requirements management tools can be time consuming and an entry barrier for discipline engineers deployed onto Projects.
We found that users were comfortable with the simplicity of spreadsheets but had no way of pushing verification and validation evidence directly into the database without knowing how to use the specialist tool.
KBR have taken the simplicity of spreadsheets to present pertinent requirements in a format familiar to discipline engineers using a dedicated web application as an exchange to push verification and validation evidence data directly into the requirements management tool. This is achieved using IBM DOORS NG RESTful application programming interface (API) which is based on the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) standards.
Integration proved to be quite challenging, not only in designing an intuitive user interface which streamlines efficiency and supports real time data interactions, but also how to make the application accessible by external users, as well as preserving user authoring permissions for historical audit purposes. The important lesson here is that digital transformation does not have to be complex, it’s the large volume simple repetitive tasks that we should be aiming to automate first, leveraging simple solutions for maximum gain, before embarking on elaborate complex automations.

21214,"Overview
The power of digital represents an opportunity to fundamentally accelerate and transform the engineering lifecycle, but we must do so correctly. Digitization done poorly will enhance practices but silo practitioners. Embracing a holistic systems perspective enables us to digitalize engineering, empower radical collaboration, and adopt a new model for engineering systems.
Context
The various engineering disciplines have largely digitized their practices including the advancement and adoption of MBSE for systems engineering. However, many organizations and their supporting practices remain siloed. Integrations between teams and lifecycle phases remain largely constrained by old practices and organizational constraints slowing engineering progress and losing knowledge.
Purpose
Transformation requires more than simply digitizing existing practices. We must reconceptualize what is possible given the unprecedented computing power and data storage capacity of today. This includes ways of working within given disciplines and processes. More importantly, it requires that we look across the engineering lifecycle addressing workflows and interfaces to transform the engineering system rather than its constituent components.
Approach
For over 30 years, I have worked with government and commercial organizations as they assess, adopt, and deploy new methods and tools to enhance their engineering enterprise – first MBSE and now digital thread, digital twin, and digital engineering. I have observed common patterns across organizations and disciplines. Looking to fundamental system concepts allows one to transform from the traditional Vee lifecycle model to a series of U’s through concurrency, modularity, and integration powered by digital flows.
Insights
By changing our perspectives – from digitization to digitalization, from serial to parallel, from part to whole, from siloed to collaborative – we embrace a new lifecycle model, meet the promise of digital engineering, and deliver transformative results as we engineer the future.","From I to We, From Vee to Us: A Model for Engineering Systems","David Long 1, Blue Holon, Blacksburg, VIRGINIA, United States",

 It often constitutes a significant yet underestimated aspect of project delivery. While the focus typically centres on the delivery of physical infrastructure and systems, a critical gap emerges during the transition from the ‘completion of project delivery’ to ‘placing the system into service’. This challenge is further compounded when projects introduce new, novel, and/or complex systems into service and into their scope —such as novel technologies, new operating environments and/or complex organisational change.
 This paper explores techniques and processes that can be adopted to facilitate a more efficient and effective journey to operational readiness. Drawing from case studies across various transport modes, it is discussed how these practices can be adapted and scaled to meet diverse operational requirements, irrespective of industry. By providing a detailed understanding of the necessary activities, this paper aims to bridge the gap in project preparedness during early delivery phases. Additionally, it presents examples of operational readiness delivery processes, highlighting their application in rail and bus projects within Australia and how these can also be adopted in other industries like Defence and Health.

Technology advancements in modelling, simulation, and visualization provide practitioners with decision-making data that is more representative of a system of interest than ever. The combination of these technologies and their utilization is referred to as Digital Engineering. However, the misconception that digital engineering can only be utilized if adopted early in the system lifecycle inhibits its adoption in operation/sustainment phases of a system’s lifecycle.
Transformation programs require the deliberate and staged planning and implementation of significant changes to a system of interest. The number of stakeholders, suppliers and other interested parties grows exponentially if that system is a System of Systems (SoS) and that SoS is a complex enterprise.

Facilitated group discussion exploring the ""good enough"" engineering principle.
 
Overview
In an era of rapid digital transformation, Systems Engineering grapples with a critical challenge: leveraging the potential of modern tools and processes while side-stepping the crippling effects of ‘over-engineering’.
Addressing this challenge is becoming urgent. Despite the availability of modern innovations designed to streamline the engineering process – like Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and AI-driven requirements generation – projects are still grinding to a halt under the burden of excessive, inflexible and poorly tailored engineering approaches.
Tackling this challenge demands a shift in mindset – a departure from the relentless pursuit of engineering perfection, the inability to accept appropriate levels of risk, and the often-unyielding adherence to arbitrary engineering standards. It requires the uncomfortable acceptance that “good enough is good enough”.
This workshop will explore how the “good enough” concept, when embedded as a core principle within our engineering approaches, can lead us out of the “over-engineering” trap, and unlock the full potential of our existing, and future, digital toolsets.
 
Opportunity for interaction
Participants will engage in a facilitated discussion exploring their experiences with over-engineering and the good-enough engineering approach.

21234,"Overview –
A novel Capella viewpoint has been developed to enrich a Systems Engineering Model with Mission Engineering concepts.  This presentation will explore the use and value of such a viewpoint when employed with Model Based Systems Engineering techniques.
- Context –
Mission engineering provides an approach with appropriate rigour for the acquirer of capability to clearly outline their needs and expectations of solutions to meet their needs.  Model Based Systems Engineering provides an approach to effectively master complexity of a system from concept to implementation.  Harmonising the two viewpoints is not straightforward.
- Purpose –
This presentation will demonstrate a prototype viewpoint for the Capella MBSE tool which will allow the representation of Mission Engineering concepts within the MBSE model.  By enhancing the operational concept representation and enriching that representation with key Mission Engineering views and measures, the system designer should make better decisions when architecting and implementing the system.
- Approach –
A Capella model viewpoint (add on) has been developed and will be demonstrated interactively to show how the additional Mission Engineering concepts can be leveraged throughout a system's lifecycle in an example model. Key mission engineering concepts such as Mission Threads and Mission Engineering Threads, Measures of Success, Performance and Effectiveness will be demonstrated.  How these new elements can be leveraged through a system design will be explored.
- Insights –
By formally representing Mission Engineering concepts into the implementation of systems through Model Based Engineering approaches, Systems acquirers and designers should be able to talk the same language, across the different contexts, which will improve outcomes for the development of prime items and complex systems integration.

21235,"Overview:  
One of the challenging concepts in shaping the future of Systems Engineering and preparation of a Digital future includes the complexity associated with ‘Tools and Data integration’. [SE Vision 2035]
The complexity exists between many different types of tool sets and technologies used, and the effort required to exchange data between them. There is a Need to simplify this approach as much as possible.
One such method, which we will explore to accomplish this, is through the use of Open Standards and Open Architectures.
Context:
Such approaches to this problem, may include the adoption of common interface standards, languages, schema’s and modular based architectures.
The presentation will provide a brief look into the relevant standards bodies; examples of existing open systems and languages, and how they may be utilised for developing Digital Engineering capabilities. Exploring the issues of stove piping, which typically inhibit the sharing of data openly across the system lifecycle.
Purpose:
This presentation will provide an outline of the challenges associated with closed systems, and a fresh look at the benefits of an open system in the context of implementing Digital Engineering capabilities. Outlining the key challenges associated with Tools and Data integration as described in the Systems Engineering vision for 2035. There is now a growing need and urgency to standardise our approach, in order to access, share, collaborate, and reuse data.
Approach:
By using Open Standards, the complexity of integration is reduced, resulting in a wide number of benefits, which this presentation will discuss in further detail.
Insights:
This is advantageous for the replacement of future Digital Engineering systems, which can then utilise those standardised interfaces and integrate easier.
From this presentation, we will recognise the need for such open standards to enable us to implement Digital Engineering capabilities now, and in the future.",The Importance of Open Standards and Architectures for Integrated Digital Engineering Capabilities,"JORDAN MARSHALL 1, QINETIQ AUSTRALIA, Mt Duneed, VICTORIA, Australia",

21240,"Overview This work explores the application of Unreal Engine in the digital test and evaluation (DT&E) domain, highlighting its potential to revolutionize testing methodologies. 
Context The DT&E domain is undergoing significant transformation, driven by the need for more precise and efficient testing frameworks that can support the capture of objective quality evidence and augment traditional assurance activities. Traditional methods often fall short in terms of scalability and adaptability to complex scenarios and the ability to deliver with an accelerated timeline. 
Purpose The primary objective of this research is to assess how Unreal Engine can support emerging trends within the DT&E domain. The evaluation criteria was based around the idea that Unreal Engine's advanced simulation capabilities can significantly improve the realism and scalability of DT&E processes. The investigation aims to understand the practical benefits and potential limitations of integrating Unreal Engine into DT&E workflows.
Approach The research adopted an Agile Methodology to deliver a Minimal Viable Product that could demonstrate the viability of integrating Unreal Engine into DT&E workflows. Simulations were created using Unreal Engine, replicating various DT&E scenarios. These simulations were evaluated based on their realism, scalability, and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Integration options were also explored to ascertain the viable use of higher fidelity models and information sources.
Insights Key insights reveal that Unreal Engine significantly enhances the realism of DT&E simulations, providing an immersive and accurate testing environment. Additionally, its scalability allows for the efficient handling of complex scenarios, which is often a limitation of traditional methods.

21241,"Overview
This paper explores the feasibility of using cost-effective tools like DevOps and Jira for systems engineering tasks traditionally done on expensive tools such as DOORS or Relatics.
This presentation would be of interest to people/businesses that work on small-medium size projects looking for a cost-efficient way to manage system lifecycle.
Context
Life cycle model approach is a Systems engineering framework that can help successful realisation of a system. Tools like DOORS and Relatics help engineers develop a system using the life cycle (V) model approach. However, the costliness of tools can pose as a potential barrier to effective systems engineering practices. In contrast, DevOps and Jira, tools widely used in the software development and IT industries, offer cost-effective alternatives with features comparable to DOORS or Relatics for certain situations.
We know that DOORS and Relatics is not cost-effective for small-medium projects. 
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide insight on how inexpensive tools can provide a viable alternative and prevent cost from being a barrier to preforming good systems engineering practices. The paper will provide potential processes, templates and use cases that can be used to maximise the benefit of the cost-effective tools.
We are trying to show that tools like DevOps and Jira can help make systems engineering more prominent by removing the cost barrier as well as how to best use these tools. 
Approach
The paper will simulate a project and showcase how the v-model approach can be achieved using one of the cost-effective tools.
The presentation will go through a project life cycle and show how to best use the cost-effective tool.
Insights
This paper aims to inform readers that there are alternative options available to DOORS and Relatics that may be more cost-effective, that are not Excel and Word.

21248,"Overview: This session offers practical tools for everyone, from beginners to seasoned information security professionals. By understanding and utilising MITRE's ATT&CK (Adversarial-Tactics-Techniques-and-Common-Knowledge) and D3FEND (Detection-Denial-and-Disruption-Framework-Empowering-Network-Defence) frameworks, participants will gain insights into securing systems using a risk-based and holistic approach to cyber exposure in both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT).
Context: In the ever-evolving realm of IT/OT cybersecurity, threats advance faster than organisations can keep up. The ATT&CK+D3FEND frameworks provide an effective approach to understanding and counteracting the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors. These frameworks are enablers for managing and mitigating security risks in modern technical and socio-technical systems.
Purpose: The presentation shows how ATT&CK+D3FEND offer a common language to guide professionals in current offensive and defensive TTPs. This enables participants to assess current systems and inform development of secure-by-design systems. By mapping and understanding the threat surface, participants will be able to determine how to secure systems and data assets effectively, considering the risk exposure involved.
Approach: The session will use real-world examples of the ATT&CK+D3FEND frameworks to demonstrate their application. The Cybersecurity-and-Infrastructure-Security-Agency (CISA) generated a report explaining how to defend against Volt-Typhoon, a Chinese state-sponsored hacker group. This report, co-authored by the Australian-Signals-Directorate (ASD) and the Australian-Cyber-Security-Centre (ACSC), details how Volt-Typhoon accessed US critical infrastructure over the past five years.
Insights: Participants will learn how to leverage ATT&CK+D3FEND to identify TTPs related to Advanced-Persistent-Threat (APT) groups targeting specific industries, and how to detect and mitigate these TTPs.

21249,"In the emergent digital landscape, the evolution of Synthetic Test & Evaluation (ST&E) applications in systems engineering is essential, offering value in overcoming real-world testing constraints. This presentation explores the evolution of Synthetic Test & Evaluation applications in systems engineering, particularly for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and multi-UAV systems (swarms). We will present modelling and simulation of UAV power consumption to predict system performance, demonstrating how ST&E can complement traditional testing methodologies, addressing real-world constraints and enhancing efficiency.  
The operational adaptability and configurability of Commercial and Military off-the-shelf UAVs present significant challenges to conventional Test and Evaluation (T&E) methods, which are often costly, time-consuming, and logistically demanding. Existing methods struggle to keep up with the dynamic nature of UAV technology.  
The research aims to understand and demonstrate the effectiveness of a synthetic approach to Test and Evaluation for UAVs. The hypothesis is that validated Modelling & Simulation (M&S) can contribute to both ST&E and digital mission engineering throughout the life cycle, improving resource allocation, risk mitigation and overall mission performance assessment.  
Nova Systems’ hybrid Test and Evaluation framework combines Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and M&S with physical testing to verify and validate UAV performance. The study collected and analysed data on power consumption and battery utilization under various payloads and flight scenarios to validate the synthetic model’s presentation of real-world UAV behaviour.  
The benefits of synthetic testing extend beyond validation, with impacts across the system life cycle. By facilitating comprehensive system and mission analysis across the life cycle, ST&E can enhance operational efficiency, risk mitigation, and resource optimisation. Its integration into the broader framework of systems engineering not only augments traditional T&E practices but also drives the advancement of the digital mission.   ",T&E for Model Validation to Support Synthetic V&V Outcomes,"Terence De Jong 1, Janice Wong 1, Jeet Shah 2, Digital Engineering, Nova Systems, Newstead, QLD, Australia, Digital Engineering, Nova Systems, Southbank, VIC, Australia",

From an engineer’s POV. A key step of the risk management life cycle is to determine the appropriate response to each risk. The goal of effective risk management is to identify ways to keep risk aligned with the risk appetite or tolerance in as cost-effective a way as possible.
Engineers need to take an overall risk assessment of the project involved with IT, only focused on the software system.  This outline is to look at all the inputs, the people involved and their responsibilities and how the risk concept can be applied, with a focus on hospitals.   An outline of progressive steps will be given.  A key item is, we are only focused on industrial projects and not consumer product developments.

This paper examines how Mission Engineering can be used to inform decision-makers attempting to deliver the most capability with the minimum amount of infrastructure. Where projects are delivered across migration stages, this paper explores how Mission Engineering and Systems Integration allow operators to map the staged capability uplift across multiple migration stages and manage the transient risk profiles across a suite of temporary configuration states.
Context                                                                                                              
Decision-makers face the challenge of maintaining or growing capability amid decreasing budgets, rapidly changing operational environments, and phased delivery of complex systems. In situations where decisions can mean significant operational limitations, identifying the impact on mission and capability empowers decision-makers to focus on best-for-project outcomes .
Purpose
This paper describes using Mission Engineering and Systems Integration methodologies to enable operators to make informed investment decisions to deliver the “Minimum Viable Capability” in the face of time, cost, and availability constraints. By understanding the relationship from capabilities to the people, process, technology, and associated risks, a delivery authority can manage project change and assess the consequences of changes in terms of capability rather than just in terms of time and cost.
Approach
Building on existing Systems Engineering frameworks used on complex projects in highly regulated industries, the view is expanded to include the lens of capability. A framework is provided that links existing artefacts (hazards, operational scenarios, test cases, GSN goals) to the mission. By viewing technical integration and operational readiness through the lens of missions and capabilities it enables delivery authorities to place complex systems into service effectively.
Insights
Projects / technology suppliers speak in terms of system functions, whilst operators speak in terms of operational capability. Establishing a framework that enables both parties to speak a common language aids collaboration and provides a common basis for making decisions.

21299,"Overview: This presentation explores approaches in Model-Based Systems Engineering that provide benefits for transport and infrastructure projects. These projects can be characterised by a focus on a detailed systems architecture, and the need for consistency and traceability in applying this architecture across multiple geographic locations. Using examples in an MBSE tool, this presentation will demonstrate how to rapidly build a coherent system model and provide meaningful artifacts to stakeholders and design teams.
Context: A simplistic approach is often taken to systems architecture in teaching and initial project implementation. There is a system of interest, which is built from a hierarchy of systems components (from segments and subsystems down to individual configuration items). In many large projects, the physical systems architecture can be multi-dimensional, with multiple levels of system breakdowns, with implementation at multiple locations, along with the need for specific customisations or variants.
Purpose: A sample model being presented demonstrates the basic characteristics of a rail transport infrastructure project. This sample is explored and extended via features available in MBSE tools, to show techniques that can improve the quality, speed and consistency of the models and artefacts being produced.
Approach: For this approach, practical methods from product-line engineering, in object-oriented methods and in existing model-based systems engineering tools are explored and demonstrated. This includes aspects of model reuse, abstraction, inheritance and parameterisation, specifically applied to the physical architecture of a systems model.
Insights: Using these techniques, improvements can be shown in the “elegance of design” (defined by forming the least complex sufficient solution), the minimisation of effort in modelling (and increased efficiency of implementing changes), and the quality, clarity and consistency of diagrams and representations drawn from the model content.

21304,"Brisbane Metro, an all-electric, high-capacity turn-up-and-go public transport system, is designed to link the city to the suburbs, through two new Brisbane Metro lines. Reducing congestion bottlenecks in the city for a better-planned network, the new service aims to meet the growing demand for reliable travel options. Brisbane Metro delivery includes the introduction of 60 new battery electric metro vehicles, a new technologically advanced depot, new and upgraded infrastructure providing targeted investment to augment the capacity of Brisbane’s busway network, a new operational bus network, policy and operational changes, and a new intelligent transport system.
The novelty of the project, the first of its kind in Brisbane, Australia, and the southern hemi-sphere, will unintentionally set a precedent for how future projects of similar nature may implement and delivery a successful operational service. While Brisbane City Council has delivered a wide range of major projects, the planning and delivery of Brisbane Metro has been its largest and most complex undertaking to-date. The integration of new and novel systems into an existing transport ecosystem has required a holistic network planning approach.
The unique elements of Brisbane Metro has driven the need to assess Council’s model for operational readiness and the implementation of a systems engineering and integration approach, particularly in regard to the transition to operations and handover of the assets. Utilising experience from different industries and external support, a methodology of combining best practice from the rail industry and bus industry along with scaling processes and approaches enabled the definition of its own distinct assurance process.
This paper will discuss the process and methodology undertaken as part of operational readiness activities, highlighting lessons learnt, and how this can be applied to future projects as they transition into operations.",Operational Readiness for Brisbane Metro,"Monica Dryden 1, Andrew Purcell 2, Mott MacDonald, Melbourne, VIC, Australia, Operational Readiness, Brisbane City Council, Brisbane, QLD, Australia",

21307,"Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) technology shows great promise in providing economic and societal benefits across the world. In response to this demand, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority, as well as their counterparts internationally, has been actively refining its regulations to address the rapidly evolving landscape of UAS technology and applications. One notable development in this regard is the adoption of the Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA), which represents a significant step towards enhancing the safety and regulatory oversight of UAV operations in Australia (Denney et al., 2018).
The complexity of the UAS ecosystem, taking in a plurality of stakeholders, requires a comprehensive approach to assessing both technical and regulatory architectures. The complexity is such that using modelling and simulation, in the form of digital twins of the ecosystem, is likely to be the only way to achieve this comprehensive assessment.
The emergence of digital twin (DT) technology in aviation and airspace is a significant shift towards data-driven, proactive safety management practices. Leveraging digital twins to simulate, analyze, and optimize aviation systems and operations, stakeholders can improve safety, mitigate risks, and foster innovation.
This paper will discuss how digital twins can facilitate the application of SORA in the Australian regulatory context. By synthesising insights from literature on digital twins and their applications, and drawing Thales’ experience in this area, this paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the way in which DTs can be used to enable complex operations, including the associated benefits, challenges, and opportunities. The paper will also consider the broader use of digital twins in the airspace management ecosystem in Australia.",Exploring the Role of Digital Twins in Advancing SORA Compliance for BVLOS Operations in Australia,"Elita Huynh 1, Philip Swadling 1, Thales, Melbourne, VIC, Australia",

21311,"This paper explores the synergy between system engineering and extended system lifespan. We propose a novel architectural framework that integrates risk and safety principles throughout the development process to achieve this goal. Traditional engineering approaches often neglect the entire lifecycle of a system. Our framework addresses this by employing proactive risk management strategies, focusing on life cycle costs and maintainability. By emphasizing a robust architecture with built-in redundancy and modularity, the framework fosters systems that can adapt to evolving requirements and environmental stresses. This focus on long-term safety and reliability translates to a longer system lifespan, reduced resource consumption, and ultimately, a more sustainable future.
Furthermore, the paper highlights the growing importance of designing for a multi-generational product lifecycle. With second, third, and subsequent generations planned from the outset, integrated lifecycle strategies become crucial. This is particularly relevant for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, where the ability to modify and adapt systems becomes paramount as technology plateaus are reached. This approach ensures continued system viability even as the underlying technology evolves.
By emphasizing proactive risk management, life cycle considerations, and safety principles, system engineering plays a vital role in extending system lifespan and promoting ecological integrity.

21323,"Overview:
In this presentation, we delve into the practical application of Risk-Based Verification (RBV) in construction projects. By showcasing a real-world use case, we demonstrate how RBV can optimize project outcomes by strategically aligning verification efforts with high-risk requirements, thereby minimizing project disruptions and enhancing resilience.
Context:
Requirement verification is an important part of assurance in rail projects in Australia. As part of the assurance process, verification of requirements is often a time-consuming exercise, causing a burden on engineering teams. At the same time, realized assets don't always perform as intended despite the elaborate assurance processes. In response to this challenge, the adoption of RBV offers a promising approach to reduce and prioritize verification efforts based on project risks, ultimately improving project efficiency and outcomes.
Purpose:
Our presentation aims to illustrate the tangible benefits of adopting RBV in construction projects. Through a real-life example, we seek to highlight how RBV can empower project teams to reduce their verification effort, and mitigate project risks effectively, ultimately driving project success.
Approach:
By using an example how RBV has been successfully implemented during the construction of an offshore windfarm, we will share the insights into the specific challenges addressed, the RBV strategy employed, and the resulting impact on project outcomes.
Insights:
Through our exploration of the theory and implementation in one use case, we uncover key insights into the transformative potential of RBV in project delivery. From optimizing the verification effort and increasing the risk assurance, RBV emerges as a strategic tool for mitigating project risks and delivering superior outcomes. By sharing these insights, we aim to inspire audience members to consider RBV as a valuable addition to their project management toolkit.

21326,"Understanding and interpreting data, to support decision making could be done in various ways and is the foundation of Systems Engineering. The method chosen could be critical to deliver the project on time, as per schedule and within cost. While traditionally, artefact-based approach has served well so far, the rate of change of technology and relevance has resulted in evaluation of other methods and one additional method that could be complementary is the data science-based approach. In this presentation I highlight the key differences between the two approaches and propose frameworks to utilise one or the other, or both, based on the needs which can leverage data to inform decision-making at a faster pace as well as drive continuous improvement and support innovation and deliver value.
