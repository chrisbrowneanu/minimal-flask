<p>This course introduces students to fundamental skills and contextual knowledge for working with molten glass in a contemporary visual arts and/or design context.</p><p>Students will learn to manipulate and transform hot glass in response to set projects across areas of glass blowing, hot glass casting, and cold working. They will also develop knowledge of historical underpinnings for glass in contemporary practices though lectures, seminar discussions, and contextual research. This course supports materials and ideas explorations through the interface of embodied learning and conceptual inquiry. It forms part of the foundation for a specialist glass practice, while supporting non-specialist explorations of the properties and possibilities of the medium in broader visual arts and design contexts.<br>Work health and safety instruction is integrated throughout the syllabus.</p>

<p>Student contribution amounts under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 (HESA) and tuition fees support the course described in the Course Outline/Class Summary and include tuition, teaching materials and student access to the workshops for the stated course hours.</p><p>OPTIONAL WORKSHOP FEE</p><p>This<strong style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Workshop Fee</strong>&nbsp;is for additional access to the workshop and use of equipment, tooling and consumable items during extra hours. It is not essential to course completion.

<p><strong>30% of Class Grade.</strong></p><p><em>Skills 101</em> introduces methods, techniques, and technologies for transforming glass in the hot shop (hot glass studio). It encourages hands on skills’ acquisition through technical assignments, while emphasising the importance of looking, sensing and playing in mining the properties and qualities of the material in the context of a Visual Arts and/or Design practice.</p><p>To do well, students will demonstrate fundamental skills’ acquisition through assignment works (Gather/ Shape/ Inflate), show engagement with the materials qualities and properties of glass by 'testing' ideas through parallel self-directed material explorations (Mining Glass portfolio of works) and explain the relationships between works and ideas, by linking their experiments to relevant conceptual and or contextual frameworks in a 100 to 150 words rational.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Task 1 assessment comprises:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Gather / Shape / Inflate (portfolio of assignment works)</strong></li><li><strong>Mining Glass (portfolio of self-directed experiments)</strong></li><li><strong>Mining Glass Rational (100-150 words)</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>WHS compliance and Competency Training underpin all Hot Glass activities, and compliance is integrated in all Portfolio of Studio Work assessments.</p><p>The Visual Journal will accompany discussions, review and final studio portfolio submissions (see Task 5).</p><p><strong>Presentation requirements: </strong>Assignment works and experiments, supporting material (drawings, tests, models) and contextual research will be presented for review week 7.
