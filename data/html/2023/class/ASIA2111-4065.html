<p>This course examines Indonesia's foreign and security policy against the background of the country's decades-long, but still unfulfilled quest for a larger global role. As the nation with the fourth-largest population in the world, and as the third-largest democracy, Indonesia rightly aspires to expand its influence and have a greater say in international affairs. But both its foreign policy and its regional and international security policy have often been criticised as insufficient to achieve this goal. What, then, have been the hurdles to Indonesia's development into a key diplomatic and security actor? What have successive Indonesian presidents done to overcome these obstacles and increase Indonesia's international weight? How do Indonesia's neighbours, including Australia, view Indonesia's foreign and security potential, and its limitations? What is the most likely trajectory of Indonesia's foreign and security role in the decades ahead? How has the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the country hard, influenced this trajectory? </p><p> In this course, we will investigate the questions outlined above, and evaluate Indonesia's status in the web of regional powers in the Asia-Pacific region. In doing so, we will also reflect on key theoretical and conceptual questions in regards to the sources of a country's diplomatic and strategic power. Indonesia, with its quickly growing economy but continuously weak military, is a highly suitable case study for investigations into what exactly constitutes political and security influence in today's global security system.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>While it will be sufficient to read the allocated articles each week, it would be useful for you to read&nbsp;Amitav Acharya's book on Indonesia's alleged rise as a global player.

                <td>27 FEBRUARY: Concepts of Foreign and Security Policy In this class, we discuss key concepts of foreign and security policy. One of the key themes to be discussed in this context is that of “power”. What makes a state “powerful?” Is it a strong military? A big population? An effective economy? And further, what does it take for a state to be a small, middle or great power? All of these concepts will be used throughout the course in order to assess Indonesia’s status in world affairs.

                <td>6 MARCH: The Foundations of Indonesian Foreign Policy, 1945-65 This lecture discusses the origins and foundations of Indonesian foreign policy. These are inspired by the principle idea of a “free and active” [bebas dan aktif] foreign policy, which is aimed at avoiding dependence on only one great power. During much of the revolution (1945-49), the democratic period (1950-57) and the early phase of Sukarno’S guided Democracy (1959-63), this policy was applied consistently. After 1963, however, Jakarta solidly aligned with communist Beijing, raising questions about the independence of its foreign policy.

While never formally aligned, Indonesia remained a close partner of the West until 1990, when the end of the Cold War led to a deterioration in the relationship. At the end of Suharto’s rule, Indonesia’s foreign policy was once again “free and active”, with Suharto maintaining key friendships across the globe. Required reading: Michael R. Vatikiotis (1993).

While some authors say that being a democracy has changed Indonesia’s foreign policy, others believe that it has remained unchanged and still adheres to the “free and active” policy. Others again have claimed that Indonesian foreign policy has become more “Islamic”, reflecting the increasing influence of Muslim groups after democratization. In short, what exactly is “democratic” about Indonesia’s current foreign policy? Required reading: Jurgen Rueland (2017).

On the one hand, Indonesia’s large market and population make it attractive to other powers, but its consistent underperformance in the economic realm has thus far limited the economy’s ability to increase Indonesia’s foreign policy capacity. In the lecture, we look at Indonesia’s economy today, and assess its development trajectory in the next 30 years or so. In particular, we will assess the potential for Indonesia's economy to re-emerge from the COVID-19 crisis. Required reading: Titik Anas, Hal Hill, Dionisius Narjoko & Chandra Tri Putra (2022).

Internationally, Indonesia faces the rise of China’s assertiveness, especially in the South China Sea; territorial disputes with Malaysia; and a wide range of transnational crimes, including terrorism. But much of Indonesia’s security diplomacy and policy remains domestically oriented: for example, it has developed a Pacific policy specifically designed to undermine foreign support for Papuan independence.

<p><b>Tutorial Participation (10%)</b></p>
<p>You will be assessed on your tutorial participation. The assessment is primarily based on the quality of your contributions in class (and therefore, not simply on the frequency of your contributions and/or attendance.) After each tutorial, you will receive a mark. Absence is marked as zero, unless docomentation on justifiable absence is provided. At the end of the semester, the average of your eight best marks achieved throughout the semester will be your total mark for tutorial participation. In order to prepare for the tuorials, it is essential that you have read the required reading and attended/listened to the lecture of that week. The better you are prepared through reflecting on these materials (and, optionally, additional material you researched yourself), the more effectively you will be able to engage in class, and the better your mark will be.</p><p><br></p><p>For students who feel uncomfortable with public speaking in class or who face participation hurdles due to the specific circumstances created by the pandemic, the course convener accepts brief written commentaries on the main reading of the respective week as a substitute for a contribution made in class. Students who wish to make use of this opportunity should send this brief commentary to the course convener within one week of the tutorial for which the student seeks a substitute participation mark. However, such students should write to the course convener at the beginning of the semester and explain their reasons for not being able to contribute in class. Unavailability due to work commitments or similar reasons are not acceptable - the mechanism of substituting oral contributions with brief commentaries is designed to accommodate students who can't contribute in class because of the barriers mentioned above, not because of pragmatic timing issues or matters of convenience.</p>

<p>Academic integrity is a core part of the ANU culture as a community of scholars. The University’s students are an integral part of that community. The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2021L00997#_Toc35619227" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academic integrity principle</a> commits all students to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support, academic integrity, and to uphold this commitment by behaving honestly, responsibly and ethically, and with respect and fairness, in scholarly practice.</p><p><br></p><p>The University expects all staff and students to be familiar with the academic integrity principle, the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/about/governance/legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Integrity Rule 2021,</a> the <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Policy: Student Academic Integrity</a> and <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477150" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Procedure: Student Academic Integrity</a>, and to uphold high standards of academic integrity to ensure the quality and value of our qualifications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Academic Integrity Rule 2021 is a legal document that the University uses to promote academic integrity, and manage breaches of the academic integrity principle. The Policy and Procedure support the Rule by outlining overarching principles, responsibilities and processes. The Academic Integrity Rule 2021 commences on 1 December 2021 and applies to courses commencing on or after that date, as well as to research conduct occurring on or after that date. Prior to this, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L02025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Misconduct Rule 2015</a> applies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The University commits to assisting all students to understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity.
