For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>

<p><b>Option 2A: In-class or Video Presentation</b></p>
<p><strong>Brief Description: </strong>Beginning in Week 4 and ending in Week 12, students will have an opportunity to make oral class presentations of 15 minutes, or a 10 minute video presentation, based primarily on the ‘issues for consideration’ for each week’s topic in the course outline, or a topic of the student's choice approved by the convenor. Note that students are entitled to think broadly and critically for their presentations eg they can present 'reflective' pieces, present advocacy strategies, develop critiques or defences of government or NGO approaches, and can incorporate visuals, interviews (real or mock), animations, or any other creative elements that enhance the presentation.</p><p><br></p><p>The number of class presentations will be capped at 18. Selection will be made on a first come, first serve basis. Nomination for presentation topics and weeks will be made available at <strong>5pm on 1 August 2023. </strong>Two students may make class presentations at each seminar – or more in the event of joint presentations.</p><p>Each student making a presentation will submit a summary of <strong>approximately </strong>200 words to the course convenor by email <strong>before </strong>the presentation is given.</p><p>The summary will be posted on the presentation page on Wattle, and will also assist in assessment of the class presentation, but assessment of the summary will not result in a lower mark than would be awarded for the oral presentation.</p><p><br></p><p>Students can undertake joint presentations, but each student must speak separately in order for the lecturer to differentiate student performance.</p><p>Presentations will vary significantly in topic, content, approach, style and technique. As a result, the weighting given to different aspects of the rubric and the expectation of the attainment of key ELOs will differ in each instance. There is not one assessment 'box' into which every student can be placed. The objective of the exercise to allow for diversity to thrive.</p><p>Nonetheless, most topics will allow students to develop 'advanced knowledge of the substance, rationale, and history of [relevant] the legal norms' (LO 1); familiarity with the legal problems arising out of interpretation and application of the Convention [or indeed other relevant instruments] (LO 2); an ability to discuss policy issues thereby generated (LO 3); an ability to identify relevant sources critiquing Australian law and policy (LO 4 – this will clearly not be relevant to all presentations); to attain technical skills for ascertaining and communicating an independent understanding of different perspectives of the legal / policy / theoretical issues researched (ELOs 5-6) and, where relevant, develop a critical understanding of the role of lawyers and law to the problem at hand (LO 7).</p><p><strong>Nature of Task: </strong>Compulsory (unless submitting "2B Submission on behalf of a hypothetical claimant"), and non-redeemable. Non-completion of this assessment task will result in receiving 0 for the task.</p><p><strong>Value or Weighting: </strong>25% (Or 0% if 2B is completed instead)</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>5pm, Monday 1 August 2023</p><p><strong>Due Date: </strong>Class presentations will take place in class between weeks 4 and 12. Video presentations are due at 5pm on Wednesday 20 September 2023.</p><p><strong>Word Limit: </strong>N/A<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Estimated Return Date: </strong>Two weeks after presentation via Wattle.</p><p><strong>Individual Assessment in Group Tasks:</strong> Where students deliver a joint presentation, they will receive a joint assessment, but individual feedback based on their identified contributions in keeping with ANU policy which requires that students be provided with an opportunity to demonstrate their skills as individuals.</p><p><strong>Assessment Criteria:</strong></p><p>1. Understanding and discussion of relevant law and policy</p><p>2. Critical and analytical response to relevant material or question/task; development of argument and/or answer to the question</p><p>3.

<p><b>Option 2B: Submission on Behalf of a Hypothetical Claimant</b></p>
<p><strong>Brief Description: </strong>You will be provided with two to four hypothetical claimant situations. Students are to identify the relevant legal issues which arise in one chosen scenario, and to address at least two questions of law in detail by reference to relevant jurisprudence, applying the law to the facts before them.&nbsp;</p><p>The Factual situations will be kept deliberately brief. Students may speculate about the existence and nature of certain facts which would need to be ascertained in an interview, but should not depart unduly from the facts given. Students are expected, where relevant, to refer to relevant country information in their answers. The focus should be on presenting brief but relevant legal arguments by reference to relevant case law and legislation in Australia. Cases from other jurisdictions can be cited, as can UNHCR materials, but not at the expense of Australian jurisprudence on point.</p><p>Students have a choice of considering the claims either: a) from the position of a legal representative for the asylum-seeker, making legal arguments for one’s client accordingly; or b) from the position of a lawyer being asked legal advice in which you can discuss the strength of the legal arguments and their likelihood of success.</p><p><strong>Nature of Task:</strong> Compulsory (unless delivering a class presentation as described in "2A. In-class Presentation"), and non-redeemable. Non-completion of this assessment task will result in receiving 0 for the task.</p><p><strong>Value or Weighting:</strong> 25% (Or 0% if 2A is completed instead)</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> Friday 25 August 2023 on Wattle</p><p><strong>Due Date:</strong> 5pm, Wednesday 20 September 2023. Late submissions (without an extension) are permitted, but late penalties will apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Word Limit:</strong> 1,500 words, or 15-20 minutes if taking up the option to present oral arguments before a hypothetical member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or Judge of the Federal Court.</p><p><strong>Estimated Return Date:</strong> 16 October 2023.</p><p><strong>Assessment Criteria:</strong></p><p>1.

<p><b>Option 3A: Research Essay</b></p>
<p><strong>Brief Description: </strong>The research assignment is designed to give students an opportunity to explore a specific issue in refugee law in depth, engaging with the scholarship and jurisprudence in the area. Topics can vary from an examination of contemporary case law in Australia or overseas, to questions about the current state of the discipline from a theoretical perspective. The lecturers will provide a list of suitable topics on WATTLE in Week 3. However, students are encouraged to formulate their own topics. These can be based on, but cannot be identical to, the topic upon which a student writes or presents in assessment tasks 2A or 2B. <u>The topic must be approved by the convenors by the end of week 8 (at the latest)</u></p><p><br></p><p>As with class presentations, research papers will vary significantly in topic, content, orientation, approach, style and technique. As a result, the weighting given to different aspects of the rubric and the expectation of the attainment of key LOs will differ in each instance. For instance, some students may choose to focus on theoretical and critical issues, others will want to dig into a specific legal problem using traditional legal tools. Some will write in a polemical style; others will approach their topic with more detachment. These are all legitimate approaches, allowing students to place weight on the development of different but complementary skills.</p><p>Despite this deliberate diversity, all topics will provide students with an opportunity to develop 'advanced knowledge of the substance, rationale, and history of [relevant] the legal norms' (LO 1); familiarity with the legal problems arising out of interpretation and application of the Convention [or other relevant instruments] (LO 2); an ability to discuss policy issues thereby generated (LO 3); an ability to identify relevant sources critiquing Australian law and policy (LO 4 – this will clearly not be relevant to non-Australian topics); to attain technical skills for ascertaining and communicating an independent understanding of different perspectives of the legal / policy / theoretical issues researched (LOs 5 and 6) and, where relevant, sharpen their critical understanding of the role of lawyers and law to the problem at hand (LO 7). As noted, however, different LOs will come to fore depending upon the topic developed.</p><p><strong>Nature of Task: </strong>Compulsory (unless undertaking 3B Law Reform Submission) and non-redeemable. Non-completion of this assessment task will result in a 0 for the task</p><p><strong>Value or Weighting: </strong>55%</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>Essay topics will be released on Wattle in Week 3.

<p><b>Option 3B: Law Reform Proposal/Submission</b></p>
<p><strong>Brief Description: </strong>This component is aimed at encouraging students to think deeply about current problems with, and potential changes to, refugee law. The student/s must research parts of the relevant law warranting review or reform and use case studies to illustrate the need for review or reform. The area of law can be domestic or international, and must be approved by the lecturers. Students can also undertake a submission in pairs. Members of a pair must submit a ‘statement’ of contributions, in which they acknowledge that they all contributed equally (or set out how the load was spread), and identify their respective contributions.</p><p><br></p><p>The primary task will be a law reform submission to a real or hypothetical review body. This provides an opportunity for students to develop a very specific skill set and communication technique. Students may also use 750-850 words of the word count towards an Opinion Editorial (Op-Ed) to accompany the submission. Guidance will be given to students interested in taking this option instead of the Research Assignment. Although the assessment criteria will be somewhat different as a result, the length of the piece will ensure an opportunity to develop all LOs.</p><p><br></p><p>In the course of researching and analysing a specific legal problem, and writing a persuasive law reform submission, students will be provided with an opportunity to develop 'advanced knowledge of the substance, rationale, and history of [relevant] the legal norms' (LO 1); familiarity with the legal problems arising out of interpretation and application of the Convention [or other relevant instruments] (LO 2); an ability to discuss policy issues thereby generated (LO 3); an ability to identify relevant sources critiquing Australian law and policy (LO 4 – this will clearly not be relevant to non-Australian topics); to attain technical skills for ascertaining and communicating an independent understanding of different perspectives of the legal / policy / theoretical issues researched (LOs 5 and 6) and, in particular, sharpen their critical understanding of the role of lawyers and law to the problem at hand (LO 7).</p><p><strong>Nature of Task: </strong>Compulsory (unless undertaking 3A Research Essay) and non-redeemable. Non-completion of this assessment task will result in a 0 for the task</p><p><strong>Value or Weighting: </strong>55%</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>the lecturers may suggest potential topics as they arise. Students must confirm what topic they are doing by the end of Week 8 at latest.</p><p><strong>Due Date: </strong>5pm Wednesday 25 October 2023. Late submissions (without an extension) are permitted, but late penalties will apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Word Limit: </strong>3,000 words or 6,000 if undertaken as a pair.</p><p><strong>Extensions</strong>: Late submissions (without an extension) are permitted, but late penalties will apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Referencing Requirements: </strong>Refer to the current edition of the AGLC.</p><p><strong>Other Requirements: </strong>Text should be double-spaced.
