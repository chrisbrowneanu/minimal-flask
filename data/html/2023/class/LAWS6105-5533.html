<p>This course in Australian Public Law reflects the distinctive vision of the ANU JD program in which the study of Australian Public Law is a compulsory part. It also reflects the particular emphasis that the ANU College of Law gives to the study and research of Australian Public Law, which ultimately is reflected in the research of the ANU College of Law and in organisations such as the Centre for International and Public Law. The study of Australian Public Law at a relatively early stage in JD studies will open a pathway into a range of additional law courses and opportunities, and to thinking about opportunities beyond the JD too. To that end, LAWS 6105 has a strong focus on foundational aspects of the discipline of Australian Public Law.</p><p><br></p><p>Australian Public Law deals with many aspects of the functioning of the key constitutional institutions of government at the national, state, and territory levels, and how those institutions interact with one another and with the Australian people. The wide-ranging impact of Australian Public Law on the Australian legal system and on Australian&nbsp;governmental, judicial and social activities means that a basic knowledge of the terminology, institutions, and substance of Australian Public Law is not only worthwhile acquiring in its own right, but is also a necessary part of the knowledge and skills of any law graduate, and of any citizen of a democratic society. This makes Australian Public Law of considerable interest, whether you choose to go into the private practice of law, to work as a government or public lawyer, or are undertaking a law degree because you consider it will be useful in another career. This JD course in Australian Public Law is designed to provide you with an understanding of the core essentials of this area of law, and to provide you with the foundations for further reflection on, and study of, topics in this area. The following topics will be covered:</p><ul><li>the constitutional and legislative framework for Australian public law</li><li>major concepts and themes in Australian public law, including federalism, separation of powers, constitutionalism, representative democracy, rule of law, liberalism and Indigenous sovereignty</li><li>the Legislature, including the structure of Australian legislatures, parliamentary supremacy, and express and implied constitutional limitations on legislative power</li><li>the Executive, including the structure of Executive government, executive power, and liability of the Crown</li><li>the Judiciary, including the constitutional separation of judicial power, and the administrative law implications of judicial separation</li><li>constitutional change and evolution, including constitutional amendment.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>In conjunction with <a href="/2023/course/LAWS6102">LAWS6102</a> Commonwealth Constitutional Law, this course meets the requirements of the Law Admissions Consultative Committee Prescribed Academic Areas of Knowledge for Federal and State Constitutional Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                            </p>
<ol><li>Review the role of Australia's constitution and the Australian constitutional framework, its social and ethical impacts on society, and critically evaluate the capacity for constitutional change in order to propose reforms which reflect a range of diverse perspectives.</li><li>Critically reflect on the core constitutional and foundational concepts and doctrines of Australian public law, including how these concepts and doctrines shape contemporary legal and political disputes.</li><li>Critically evaluate, through expert analysis of case law, underlying policy and the judicial method, the relevance of Australian Public Law to current political and legal developments at the national and state/territory levels, and hypothesise about possible reforms.</li><li>Select and apply a range of legally specific research principles, methods and tools appropriate to plan and execute a public law research project.</li><li>Select and apply a range of approaches to written and oral communication, and apply the professional judgment required to develop and justify creative solutions to complex legal problems and/or issues in the context of advising a client on an Australian public law matter.</li><li>Synthesise and evaluate a range of primary and secondary legal sources to solve complex public law problems or issues and predict how unresolved and/or ambiguous questions of public law could be resolved by the courts.</li></ol>

<p><b>Ten Weekly Online Reading Quizzes</b></p>
<p><strong>Details of Task</strong>: This course expects weekly reading of cases and relevant readings, and expects students to keep up to speed with the class materials. The <u>optional</u> weekly online quizzes are designed to assist students in staying engaged with classes and readings (especially the flagship readings) throughout the course. The quizzes are worth 0% - they are not for credit - they are formative rather than summative. It is <u>not</u> anticipated that any additional study or revision will be required for a student who is consistently engaged with classes and with the readings (and, especially, with the ‘flagship readings’). There will be at least ten online quizzes, one held each week in weeks 2-5, 7-12 (inclusive). It will be each student’s responsibility to choose which weeks they wish to engage with the quiz and to ensure they begin, and complete, each quiz within the prescribed time periods. A sample of what to expect will be shown to students in class before the first quiz goes live.</p><p><strong>Nature of Task</strong>: Optional. Formative. Worth 0%.</p><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 15 mins. Once you log into the quiz, you will have 15 minutes to complete it. The quiz will finish automatically after 15 minutes and any open attempts will automatically close and be submitted so please allow sufficient time to complete the quiz.</p><p><strong>Weighting</strong>: 0%. Each week will generate a mark out of 1, but this will not count toward the final grade.</p><p><strong>Release Date</strong>: The quizzes will take place in each of weeks 2-5, 7-12 (inclusive) -- and may be offered in additional weeks. The quizzes will become available on Wattle shortly after the scheduled end time of classes (time to be confirmed in class) and will remain available until 5pm Sunday following the class.</p><p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Weekly as per the above.</p><p><strong>Estimated Return Date:&nbsp;</strong>Every effort will be made to have results available on Wattle immediately or soon after the quiz closing.</p><p><strong>Other requirements</strong>: Please note that there are occasionally IT issues that affect the functioning of particular quizzes or of Wattle generally. This will be borne in mind by the Course Convener throughout.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Assessment Criteria:</strong></p><p>1. Accurate understanding of the relevant principles</p><p><em>In undertaking all assessment in this course, students must comply with the principles of academic integrity / academic honesty.

<p><b>Final Examination</b></p>
<p><strong>Details of Task</strong>: The exam will be a traditional invigilated exam during the end-of-semester exam period. Students will have a choice of questions and significant in-class time will be devoted to exam preparation, technique, format, etc. The whole course is ‘examinable’. A rubric will be provided to students before the exam. As that rubric will make clear, particular attention will be paid, when marking, to students’ thoughtful demonstrated understanding of, and reflection on, the case law and other sources as they apply to the particular question asked. The corollary is this: answers that principally regurgitate slabs of notes will be penalised in the marking. The exam will likely be open book, students will be working alone without collaborating, and will be subject to the rules of academic integrity and honesty.</p><p><strong>Nature of Task</strong>: Compulsory and non-redeemable.

<p>Academic integrity is a core part of the ANU culture as a community of scholars. The University’s students are an integral part of that community. The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2021L00997#_Toc35619227" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academic integrity principle</a> commits all students to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support, academic integrity, and to uphold this commitment by behaving honestly, responsibly and ethically, and with respect and fairness, in scholarly practice.</p><p><br></p><p>The University expects all staff and students to be familiar with the academic integrity principle, the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/about/governance/legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Integrity Rule 2021,</a> the <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Policy: Student Academic Integrity</a> and <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477150" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Procedure: Student Academic Integrity</a>, and to uphold high standards of academic integrity to ensure the quality and value of our qualifications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Academic Integrity Rule 2021 is a legal document that the University uses to promote academic integrity, and manage breaches of the academic integrity principle. The Policy and Procedure support the Rule by outlining overarching principles, responsibilities and processes. The Academic Integrity Rule 2021 commences on 1 December 2021 and applies to courses commencing on or after that date, as well as to research conduct occurring on or after that date. Prior to this, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L02025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Misconduct Rule 2015</a> applies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The University commits to assisting all students to understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity. All coursework students must complete the online Academic Integrity Module (Epigeum), and Higher Degree Research (HDR) students are required to complete research integrity training. The <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Integrity website</a> provides information about services available to assist students with their assignments, examinations and other learning activities, as well as understanding and upholding academic integrity.</p>                                                <h2 id="onlinesubmission">Online Submission</h2>
