<p>The Master of Science Communication Research Project involves a substantive investigation of an approved topic in science communication. </p><p>Students devise their own science communication research project in collaboration with the supervisor, or can pursue a topic already offered by the supervisor. The project should be devised and conducted with journal publication in mind as the desired end goal.</p><p>The course can be taken as 18 or 24 units completed within a single semester, or two consecutive semesters. Students will complete a minimum of 18 units in this course, but students who hope to use the Master of Science Communication program as a stepping stone to higher degree research are advised to complete a total of 24 units. The course convener can advise on this decision.</p><ul><li>The 18-unit version of the course entails a research project with a significant original component, aspiring to professional-level data collection and analysis, with ethics approval required for any human participant element.&nbsp;</li><li>The 24-unit version of the course involves a research project as for the 18-unit version, plus compulsory research methods training. This training could involve completing specific, externally provided research training activities (such as the online courses offered by the Statistical Consulting Unit) to an acceptable standard, or completing a 4000 word literature review on relevant research methods to an acceptable standard, or similar. The research methods training is a hurdle requirement which doesn't contribute to the final mark, but has to be completed to pass the course. The course convener will set and assess this item, in consultation with the supervisor and student.</li></ul><p>Students must discuss their project ideas with the course convener prior to enrolling in the course to ensure they enrol in the appropriate version and that an appropriate supervisor can be found.</p>

                                Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
                            </p>
<ol><li>Plan and engage in an independent and sustained critical investigation and evaluation of a chosen research topic.</li><li>Systematically identify relevant theory and concepts, relate these to appropriate methodologies and evidence, and draw appropriate conclusions.</li><li>Engage in systematic discovery and critical review of appropriate and relevant information sources.</li><li>Appropriately apply statistical or other evaluation processes to original data.</li><li>Understand and apply ethical standards of conduct in the collection and evaluation of data and other resources.</li><li>Communicate research concepts and contexts clearly and effectively both in writing and orally.</li></ol>
                            <h2 id="research-led-teaching">Research-Led Teaching</h2>
<p>The entire course is devoted to developing research skills and conducting original science communication research for potential publication. Students will learn core knowledge about conducting science communication research and will implement that, will be asked to reflect on their research journey, and will translate their research for a broader audience.</p>                                                                                                                                                    <h2 id="recommended-resources">Recommended Resources</h2>
<p><strong>Recommended student system requirements&nbsp;</strong></p><p>ANU courses commonly use a number of online resources and activities including:</p><ul><li>video material, similar to YouTube, for lectures and other instruction</li><li>two-way video conferencing for interactive learning</li><li>email and other messaging tools for communication</li><li>interactive web apps for formative and collaborative activities</li><li>print and photo/scan for handwritten work</li><li>home-based assessment.</li></ul><p>To fully participate in ANU learning, students need:</p><ul><li>A computer or laptop. Mobile devices may work well but in some situations a computer/laptop may be more appropriate.</li><li>Webcam</li><li>Speakers and a microphone (e.g. headset)</li><li>Reliable, stable internet connection. Broadband recommended. If using a mobile network or wi-fi then check performance is adequate.</li><li>Suitable location with minimal interruptions and adequate privacy for classes and assessments.</li><li>Printing, and photo/scanning equipment</li></ul><p>For more information please see <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/systems/recommended-student-system-requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.anu.edu.au/students/systems/recommended-student-system-requirements</a></p>                                                    <h2 id="staff-feedback">Staff Feedback</h2>

<p>ANU is committed to the demonstration of educational excellence and regularly seeks feedback from students. Students are encouraged to offer feedback directly to their Course Convener or through their College and Course representatives (if applicable). Feedback can also be provided to Course Conveners and teachers via the <a href="https://unistats.anu.edu.au/surveys/selt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);">Student Experience of Learning &amp; Teaching (SELT) feedback program</a>.

<p>In this course you will engage in self-directed research most of the time, under supervision. Most of the hours you devote to the course will be spent this way. The convener will also organise workshops, in which you will receive training in writing review papers, writing research papers, human participant ethics, authorship ethics, writing for 'The Conversation', and the journal paper publication process. These are not compulsory, but you are strongly encouraged to attend them in your first semester of enrolment. Provision can be made for students to attend virtually via Skype or similar upon request.</p><ul><li>The 18-unit version of the course entails a research project with a significant original component, aspiring to professional-level data collection and analysis, with ethics approval required for any human participant element.</li><li>The 24-unit version of the course involves a research project as for the 18-unit version, plus compulsory research methods training.

Generally speaking you will be entitled to about 12 hours of your supervisor's time across the duration of the project. This might take the form of fortnightly meetings across the two semesters (not during teaching breaks) or you might instead want to ask them to read and</p><p>give feedback on a piece of writing as you work towards completion.</p><p><br></p><p>If you need a staff member's assistance beyond those 12 hours, approach the course convener.</p>                                                    <h2 id="class-schedule">Class Schedule</h2>

Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.<br>If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>
