<p>Contemporary design is a vibrant field of practice characterised by applied creativity, engagement and collaboration as well as the art and craft of making. Definitions of design practice are being reformulated in response to rapid changes in technology, society and environment; design now moves across a wide range of different media, materials and contexts. In the early decades of the twenty-first century we take stock of contemporary design practice, where it has come from, and where it is going.</p><p>This course provides a grounding in concepts, practices and issues in contemporary design. Through a combination of practical work, case studies, readings and research, students will develop a critical understanding of design as a discipline in the modern context; its concepts, artefacts, processes and practices. Key themes include functional and aesthetic value; design methods and processes; planning, intention and making; and the social roles and cultural contexts of design.&nbsp;</p>

What are the attributes of this form of design? Define your terms clearly, citing sources.</li><li><strong>Social and Cultural Context </strong>- what communities, scenes or cultures is your designer part of? Who are their clients and collaborators?</li><li><strong>Process </strong>- using evidence, characterise your designer’s process.</li><li><strong>Field and Future </strong>- What is your designer’s view of their own field? What ideas about design in society are articulated? How do they see design, and their own work, changing into the future?</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Support all your points with clear evidence.

<p><b>ProblemX Design Process Report</b></p>
<p><strong>Word Length</strong>: 1000 words&nbsp;</p><p>This report will document your individual preparatory work on the ProblemX Design Project. It will demonstrate your work in research, observation, problem framing and concept development. Your report should include:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Contextual Research (1 page): </strong>Demonstrate your research into first year student experience. Refer to academic papers, student experience programs (at ANU or elsewhere), or relevant design projects. Briefly list key points, and cite all sources in full.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Observational Research (2 pages): </strong>Document your observations of the ProblemX. These can include first hand personal experience, discussions with peers, observations in the physical and digital environments. Briefly describe the observations you conducted, and present key evidence from your observations Problem Finding and Framing (1 page). Present a problem statement that builds on your research. The problem statement should not be too broad (eg “improve waste management at SoAD”) or too narrow, assuming a specific solution (eg “make an O-Week calendar for the School website”). Based on your problem statement list one or more How Might We statements. How Might We statements should be short and open enough to serve as prompts for your creative thinking.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Concept Sketches (3 pages): </strong>Present three concepts for design interventions that respond to your problem statement. Use images and text to clearly communicate the core idea of each concept.

<p><b>ProblemX Design Project</b></p>
<p>In this group project you will work individually and in groups to further investigate and understand the ProblemX topic, identify key issues, and design a proposed intervention to improve the experience for new students in the School. You will draw on your own personal experience as well as structured research and observation. Your proposed interventions may take a range of possible forms, including one or more of:</p><ul><li><strong>Information and communication</strong></li><li><strong>Physical environment </strong></li><li><strong>Events and social organisation</strong></li><li><strong>Systems and processes </strong></li></ul><p><strong></strong></p><p>Your proposal should be practical to implement with a reasonable level of time, energy and resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Group Submission</strong></p><p>Working in groups, develop a shared approach to the challenge. Draw on and combine the individual work from your Design Process Reports, with additional research if necessary. Develop and realise designs as much as possible. Depending on the form of your proposed intervention, your submission may include fully realised designs (for example where the outcomes are posters or a website) or mockups, models or renderings where they ideas are more difficult to realise (such as major events or permanent changes to buildings). Discuss with your workshop tutor and take your ideas as far as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Along with your realised design ideas provide all the information needed to show how the design would work in its context within the School and University</p><p>Describe and account for your design concept in approximately 1000 words, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Title</strong></li><li><strong>Brief Description:</strong> A one-sentence description of your project</li><li><strong>Research and Insights:</strong> Describe the research and insights that informed your concept Focus: Describe and account for the problem or issue that your design addresses</li><li><strong>Development</strong>: Briefly show and explain how your ideas developed.</li><li><strong>Outcomes: </strong>Document the outcomes of your design, and show how your design decisions address the issues you identified</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Presentations will be in class in Week 12. This non-assessable presentation is a way to share your work with your peers and gather final feedback before you submit online.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Assessment Criteria </strong></p><p>Your submission will be assessed based on how it demonstrates your ability to:</p><ol><li>Effectively research, analyse and respond to a complex design challenge (LO 4)</li><li>Develop imaginative and appropriate designs for a complex challenge (LO 1)</li><li>Structure and present information effectively (LO 2)</li><li>&nbsp;Develop and communicate design concepts (LO 3)</li><li>Participate in collaborative design processes to develop projects (LO 5)</li></ol>
