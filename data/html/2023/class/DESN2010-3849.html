<p>This course introduces students to physical technologies that interact with our bodies and environment through sensors and actuators,&nbsp;systems that are&nbsp;already&nbsp;embedded into our&nbsp;daily&nbsp;lives.&nbsp;A&nbsp;field&nbsp;of&nbsp;creative&nbsp;practice&nbsp;that is&nbsp;sometimes referred to as physical or material computing,&nbsp;this course requires no&nbsp;prior knowledge of coding or electronics, providing&nbsp;a hands-on introduction to integrating physical technologies and computing in creative practice.&nbsp;As a part of this course students&nbsp;can&nbsp;create&nbsp;their own&nbsp;devices, instruments,&nbsp;systems&nbsp;or&nbsp;wearables,&nbsp;applying&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;of interaction design&nbsp;to physical experiences.&nbsp;Through investigations of physical computing technologies, discourses and practices the course also introduces&nbsp;critical perspectives, considering how technology is a cultural and creative&nbsp;material,&nbsp;studying and testing&nbsp;how physical computing can&nbsp;be embodied, how it can integrate, mimic and intervene with systems&nbsp;that are&nbsp;environmental and behavioural, natural and engineered. While grounded in design and the visual arts, this course is suitable for any students with an interest in creative approaches to computing and electronics.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Inputs and Outputs Design Sprint</b></p>
<p>The Design Sprint is an excellent place to test, document and develop work. The format is simple, in a limited time-frame, develop a prototype that you can showcase to an audience and discuss with your peers. The sprint has been a popular context for designers, artists and makers of all kind to generate working tests for new ideas. We will use this format inside of our week 4 workshop so come prepared with your kit.</p><p><br></p><p>So far we have learned how physical computing implements techniques of sensing and actuation. Inside of this class you will be given exactly 1 hour to develop an Arduino circuit that involves at least one input and one output and present this circuit to the class. The parameters of the circuit are left considerably open so that you can generate tests that align with your own interests. After 1 hour of development students will showcase their circuits to each other to discuss and reflect.</p><p><br></p><p>Students are required to upload a photograph of their work and their .ino code file to Wattle for submission. All code should be generously commented including any references to other people's work. Verbal feedback will be delivered in class and a numeric mark will appear on Wattle. This assessment is designed to test the working knowledge and application of physical computing fundamentals. A numerical mark will indicate to the student whether they are ready to move forward or whether they need to revise the content of previous classes and dig deeper to further develop their understanding. </p><p><br></p><p>Build and Presentation in class in Week 6</p>

<p><b>Transduction Template</b></p>
<p>So far we have learned how physical computing can be understood as a series of acts of transduction, transforming one form of energy into another (eg. light into sound etc.). This independent project requires you to use the knowledge you have developed from our deep dives into physical computing topics and methodologies and apply these to create your own design that implements techniques of sensing and actuation. You may choose to incorporate analogue and/or digital components, the minimum requirements being the inclusion of at least one sensor and one actuator. These components are to be developed into a prototype that should take into consideration the phenomena and environment for which they are designed to interpret.</p><p><br></p><p>Students are required to upload a photograph of their work, a circuit diagram/drawing and their .ino code file to Wattle for submission.

<p><b>Intelligent Interventions Project Pitch</b></p>
<p>In this project you will create an interactive system as a part of a collaborative group. Demonstrate your collective knowledge of physical computing by producing an interactive object or environment that engages in an act of critical intervention. Projects may take the shape of (but not be limited to) product design, interactive art, or critical engineering. The system can include more than one Arduino circuit and could be embedded or performative.</p><p>Groups should be made up of no less than three and no more than four students.</p><p>This project will be developed and assessed iteratively. The first stage is the Project Pitch, the second is the Project Presentation and the last is the Report.</p><p><br></p><p>Project Pitch Guidelines: </p><p>Each group will give a 5 minute presentation followed by 5 minute Q&amp;A</p><p>Presentations should include the following:</p><ul><li>What you want to make</li><li>What you want to discuss/critique/intervene on</li><li>What materials/tech you need</li><li>What you already have</li><li>Who will do what</li><li>How you will achieve what you want to make</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Note: as the weeks progress after this point the above may need to change as your project develops.</p>

<p><b>Intelligent Interventions Presentations</b></p>
<p>This presentation is an important milestone to showcase your final project and to test how it might be used and interacted with. Each group will be given time to demonstrate their project. This presentation may be done through performance, games, installation, demonstration... the contexts are open. Consult with your lecturer to confirm how best to showcase your work.</p><p><br></p><p>To submit this work, you will be required to document your presentation using as many means as necessary or appropriate. All documentation files need to be hosted in a onedrive folder, the link submitted to Wattle. Make sure the link works in a browser you have not signed into to assure your lecturer has access to the files. Be sure to consider user experience and diverse media types for your documentation and if the circuit is interactive (likely!) make sure to capture how people respond and interact with it. Ideas for forms of documentation could be, circuit diagrams, slides, photographs, audio recordings, videos, arduino ino files etc. All code should be generously commented and referenced. Submissions without the working ino file and circuit diagram/drawing cannot be assessed. These assets will be useful in the the next assessment.</p><p> </p>

<p><b>Intelligent Interventions Report</b></p>
<p>The process of researching and developing a project relies heavily on documentation and literature reviews. This work is not often shown in a project's presentation while it has been instrumental for the development of the project. This report is a place to collate this information and documentation and reflect and take stock of what was developed and learned during this project.</p><p><br></p><p>This report should be a rich document to discuss your practical experiments, theorectical reflections and project development in and outside of class. For this reason it is vital that you get into the habit of documenting your work. The document should link to and embed many different media types eg. code files, drawings, photos, videos etc. The report will also be an opportunity to share your research with reference the work of “peers”, be that designers, artists, critical makers you find relevant to the projects you’re developing and importantly, the work of your fellow students. Discuss, critique, compare and analyse your work along with practitioners in the field. Be sure to reference all of the media and sources, adhering to academic standard. Analyse how your work was received by your class mates in week 12. You may discuss successes and failures and how you might choose to further develop the project if you had a chance. Submissions without the working ino file and circuit diagram/drawing cannot be assessed.</p><p><br></p><p>Group Submission.</p><p>Word Limit 1500</p>
