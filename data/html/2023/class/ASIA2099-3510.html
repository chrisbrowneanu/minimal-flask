<p><strong><em>Social Power in China</em></strong>&nbsp;shows how the family is the basic structure of power, authority, and survival through history and in modern Chinese society.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The&nbsp;family proper is an institution within which people can shelter from state intrusion, but also through which people are mobilised to state ends. So convincing is the moral authority of the family that this power structure resonates at all levels of the polity, from biological blood-relatedness to the ideological common blood of the nation-state. The family and its hierarchies, ideals, and propositions can be seen in laws, social norms, and cultural practices. Networks of kin and kin-like relatedness form the very foundation of Chinese society.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Through an in-depth exploration of the Chinese family and the transdisciplinary application of social theory and critical thinking, students will recognise that these characteristics are not limited to the Chinese world. The family, indeed, is an essential power structure across the globe, in every cultural and national context.</p><p><br></p><p>Postgraduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but are assessed separately.</p>

                <td>An Introduction to Anthropological Notions of Kinship, and to Chinese kinship This week, we will explore the question “What is kinship?” through comparative study of both Chinese and non-Chinese systems and practices. We will first look at some of the many different ways of thinking about kinship and relatedness in different societies across the world, in order to be able to better situate Chinese cases in a comparative context. We will then begin to examine the traditional form of Chinese kinship, which is patrilineal and patriarchal. in order to give a basis to understanding how this has both changed and has been remarkably persistent through the reforms and revolutions of the 20th century.

No Tutorial Presentation Film & Readings: “Nezha Conquers The Dragon King” For class this week we will read an extended analysis of one of the greatest Chinese epics, “The Investiture of the Gods” (Fanshen Yanyi), centrally featuring the impish boy-God Nezha and concerned, above all, with the moral limits of filial piety and respect for hierarchy. In class, we will watch a one-hour animated film relating one of the most important episodes from this epic, in which Nezha defies authority, dies and is brought back to life as an immortal God, and then kills his mortal father.

We will discuss the unique and essential contributions that women and men make to the family, to social and sexual reproduction, and how these are associated with all sorts of substances and symbols that, from the outside, may not be naturally identified as important in creating and affirming bonds of kinship.

We may note how male-to-male guanxi-making is the default object of study; men are typically assumed to be the ones doing the guanxi-making. But is guanxi “a male thing”—or can we better describe it as “a gendered thing”? Is guanxi a way of getting around formal rules and opposing powerful rulers—or is it a conduit of control for those very rulers? Szonyi 2017, which we read in Week 2, shows that the lineage—a constructed network of relationships, and as such steeped in guanxi that adopts kin rituals and hierarchies—can be both at once. Kinship is a type of guanxi. We also explore how ostensibly non-kin guanxi adopts and modifies kin terms and structures.

In discussion, we explore the complex guanxi practices—deal-making, factional competition and cooperation, rent distribution—that are an integral part of the state and party structure, and touch on the ongoing debate over the role that informal politics and fragmented interest groups play in perpetuating Chinese Communist Party (CCP) power. A common aphorism is that you can’t do business in China without having good guanxi—especially with government officials—and we also explore that legend. Readings Osburg, John 2013.

                    <h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
Academic integrity is a core part of our culture as a community of scholars. At its heart, academic integrity is about behaving ethically. This means that all members of the community commit to honest and responsible scholarly practice and to upholding these values with respect and fairness. The Australian National University commits to embedding the values of academic integrity in our teaching and learning. We ensure that all members of our community understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity. The ANU expects staff and students to uphold high standards of academic integrity and act ethically and honestly, to ensure the quality and value of the qualification that you will graduate with. The University has policies and procedures in place to promote academic integrity and manage academic misconduct. Visit the following <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/academic-honesty-plagiarism" target="_blank">Academic honesty & plagiarism website</a> for more information about academic integrity and what the ANU considers academic misconduct. The ANU offers a number of services to assist students with their assignments, examinations, and other learning activities. The <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/learning-development" target="_blank">Academic Skills and Learning Centre</a> offers a number of workshops and seminars that you may find useful for your studies.                                                <h2 id="onlinesubmission">Online Submission</h2>
The ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. While the use of Turnitin is not mandatory, the ANU highly recommends Turnitin is used by both teaching staff and students. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the ANU Online website.
                    <h2 id="hardcopysubmission">Hardcopy Submission</h2>
For some forms of assessment (hand written assignments, art works, laboratory notes, etc.) hard copy submission is appropriate when approved by the Associate Dean (Education). Hard copy submissions must utilise the Assignment Cover Sheet. Please keep a copy of tasks completed for your records.                                                <h2 id="latesubmission">Late Submission</h2>
<p>Late submission of assessment tasks without an extension are penalised at the rate of 5% of the possible marks available per working day or part thereof. Late submission of assessment tasks is not accepted after 10 working days after the due date, or on or after the date specified in the course outline for the return of the assessment item. Late submission is not accepted for take-home examinations.</p>                                                <h2 id="referencing-requirements">Referencing Requirements </h2>

<p>Assignments may not be re-submitted.</p>                                                                            <h2 id="privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</h2>
The ANU has made a number of third party, online, databases available for students to use. Use of each online database is conditional on student end users first agreeing to the database licensor’s terms of service and/or privacy policy. Students should read these carefully. In some cases student end users will be required to register an account with the database licensor and submit personal information, including their: first name; last name; ANU email address; and other information.

In cases where student end users are asked to submit ‘content’ to a database, such as an assignment or short answers, the database licensor may only use the student’s ‘content’ in accordance with the terms of service — including any (copyright) licence the student grants to the database licensor. Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.

If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>
Academic Quality Assurance Committee monitors the performance of students, including attrition, further study and employment rates and grade distribution, and College reports on quality assurance processes for assessment activities, including alignment with national and international disciplinary and interdisciplinary standards, as well as qualification type learning outcomes.

Since first semester 1994, ANU uses a <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/grading-scale" target="_blank">grading scale</a> for all courses. This grading scale is used by all academic areas of the University.                                                <h2 id="support-for-students">Support for students</h2>
