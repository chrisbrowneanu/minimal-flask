<p>The Applied Policy Project is part of the Crawford School of Public Policy’s suite of work integrated learning (WIL) options that promote reciprocal learning between academic studies and workplace application. This course provides students with an opportunity to undertake applied research for real-world policy organisations. Clients from the public or non-government sectors – such as government departments, think tanks, peak bodies, and advocacy groups – initiate each project. Project work can be undertaken on an individual or group basis, subject to topic suitability and demand. Students extend their academic skills into the professional world, deepening their knowledge about a substantive policy area, and learning about the work of policy organisations through the process of designing and conducting research.&nbsp;Guided by an academic advisor, in each project students are required to understand client research needs, define research questions, gather and analyse policy relevant data, and structure and produce a research report for the client.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Applied Policy Project is a unique opportunity to engage with highly capable peers. Student numbers are limited and entry is based on an application process. Students are required to submit a short pro forma application which outlines (1) their expectations of the course and how they fit with their career goals, (2) what experiences and skills they bring to the course, and (3) the names of two referees from Crawford faculty. Successful applicants will be determined by the Course Convenor. The overall learning goals of this course are to promote discipline-based concept application, to enhance applied research skills, and to encourage career literacy-based professional development.</p>

                <td><a href="/2023/course/CRWF7000">CRWF7000</a> comprises the design, structuring, conduct, and management of an applied research project initiated by a client organisation in the public or non-government sector. The course design enables students to extend their academic skills into the professional world, learning about the work of policy organisations through the research process.&nbsp;In each project, students are required to understand client research needs, define research problems, formulate research questions, gather and analyse policy relevant data, and structure and produce a research report for the client. Students can also gain professional skills in applied research methods such as effective group work, negotiating client relationships, report writing and oral presentations. As a work integrated learning course, it has overall learning goals to promote <em>discipline-based concept application</em>, to enhance <em>applied research skills</em>, and to encourage <em>career literacy-based professional development</em>.&nbsp;Consistent with these learning goals, assessment requirements for <a href="/2023/course/CRWF7000">CRWF7000</a> are integrated with the key stages of student progression during and after the research project. In addition to assessing discipline-based concept and research skills application on a real-world policy topic, the assessment tasks are designed to support the application of career literacy competencies in the context of expectations for and reflections on the project experience (for example, to understand and build individual professional preferences and skills).&nbsp;The Applied Policy Project can be completed on <em>either</em> an individual basis (individual project mode) <em>or</em> group basis (group project mode). This means that assessment requirements are <em>differentiated for each project on the basis of the project work mode,</em> noting that in group project mode there is a mix of individual and group-based assessment tasks. The specific assessment task requirements for each project work mode are explained under 'Assessment Tasks'. The timing of assessment tasks is linked to Semester Start and End Dates.</td>

The Statement is a type of ‘learning plan’ that should cover three areas:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Expectations about the project</em>. The Statement should briefly outline the research topic, client organisation and the key expectations for the project that have been discussed with and/or provided by the client organisation. Where the project is being undertaken in group project mode, the Statement should also (a) list group members and (b) summarise the key roles and responsibilities that will need to be assigned and managed as part of group based project planning. This section about 200 words.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Expectations about personal and professional development</em>. The Statement should outline the student’s ‘baseline’ understanding of their personal characteristics, work behaviours, and professional orientation. Students should identify what they want to learn about during the project experience, and what they want to learn to do, or do better. Where the project is being undertaken in group project mode, the Statement should discuss these in the context of team based work. Students must complete relevant online modules of the ANU Careers Toolkit to inform this ‘baseline’ understanding which will serve as a basis for informing and assessing professional development. The ANU Careers Toolkit modules can be accessed via the Wattle course site. This section about 350 words.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Expectations about knowledge and skills application</em>. The Statement should outline key areas of relevant discipline-based knowledge and methods, and how these are expected to be applied during the project experience. Where the project is being undertaken in group project mode, the Statement should discuss these in the context of team based work. Where relevant, the outline should relate knowledge and skills application to the student’s ‘baseline’ understanding of their personal characteristics and work preferences (see point 2, above). This section about 200 words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a learning plan, the Statement is both a prospective and retrospective document. The Statement can be used to help guide individual learning during the project experience and will be used as a basis for reflecting on achievements and professional development as part of Personal Reflections (Assessment Task 5).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The text for this course – Zina O’Leary and Jennifer Hunt, <em>Workplace Research: Conducting small-scale research in organizations,</em> Sage, London, 2016 – provides practical guidance on the articulation of concrete goals and their assessment for applied research in organisational settings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Relevant chapter of O’Leary and Hunt (2016)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 2 ‘Finding your way Through the Workplace’, pp16-36.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

For individual project mode this is an individual task.</p><p><strong>Task Description and Guidance:</strong></p><p>The Applied Policy Project is an applied research project. It requires students to understand the research process and in particular the fundamental early stages of that process: research question design, conducting a preliminary literature review to inform question design, and selecting and explaining research methods that are appropriate to the research question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Research Prospectus is a diagnostic assessment task designed to assist students in the early stages of their assigned research topic. It uses a template that requires the completion of three separate but connected sections:</p><p>1.&nbsp;<em>Articulation of a research question</em> that is clear, concise and feasible. In the early stages of research the question can be considered a ‘working’ question that may be modified as the project progresses. The question should align with, and be informed by, the literature review (Section 2, below) and the selection of research methods (Section 3, below). This section about 100 words.</p><p>2.&nbsp;<em>Preparation of a brief topic-oriented literature review</em> that surveys the research that has already been conducted in the broad areas relevant to the topic. At this stage of the research a literature review is intended to <em>inform</em> the design of a feasible research question. It is a critical review of the key concepts, findings, theories and methods that will help identify a ‘space’ in the literature for the contribution the research is expected to make. The ‘literature’ can include books, journal articles, ‘grey literature’ and official publications. There is a two-way relationship between the literature review and a clear research question: the topic provides ‘key words’ that should be used in the search phase of the review, and the review helps refine the wording of the research question. This section about 700 words.</p><p>3.&nbsp;<em>Description of the research methods</em> that will be used for data collection, and how that data will be analysed. The literature review will inform this task by mapping the types of methods (e.g. document review, data analysis) that are generally applied in related areas of research. This section must also briefly describe the rationale for using the selected methods, and in particular the ‘best fit’ for purpose. This section about 200 words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Research Prospectus<em> </em>is also designed to deliver practical benefits for the Research Report (Assessment Task 3). It will generate an important input to the final report – the topic-oriented literature review will assist in specifying a research question and inform the more expansive research oriented literature review that should appear in the final report – and it will provide early feedback.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Relevant chapters of O’Leary and Hunt (2016)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 1 ‘Understanding Small Scale Applied Research’, pp1-15.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 3 ‘Developing Practical Research Questions’, pp37-56.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 4 ‘Doing the Prep’, pp61-80.</p>

Existing data includes:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;documents or texts, e.g. policy statements, reports, research studies</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;datasets, databases and systematic reviews</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;legislation</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;media reportage and press releases</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;online data, e.g. social media content, websites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While the Report will provide experience in designing and conducting rigorous applied research, as well as in-depth knowledge on a substantive policy issue, it is not designed to make use of primary data through human research – such as project-specific interviews, surveys or focus groups – and<em> these types of data collection methods are not in scope for this course</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Report should cover the following elements:</p><p>1.&nbsp;communication of research objectives and understanding of relevant research and policy literatures</p><p>2.&nbsp;articulation of clear research question(s)</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;an analytical framework including an overview of research methods adopted</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;empirical analysis of findings structured and informed by the analytical framework</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;the main conclusions and, where relevant, acknowledgement of limitations and suggested lines of related future research.</p><p>Each of these elements, which broadly correspond with stages of the research process, is important for conducting and reporting rigorous research. The elements align with the assessment criteria for the Research Report.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The text for this course – Zina O’Leary and Jennifer Hunt, <em>Workplace Research: Conducting small-scale research in organizations,</em> Sage, London, 2016 – provides practical guidance on planning and conducting each stage of the research project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Research Report is the primary means for assessing the discipline-based concept application component of course learning goals. These include demonstrating:&nbsp;</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;concept understanding and application through relevant research questions and methodology in policy and governance</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;integration of theory and practice through analytical framework development</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;logical and coherent arguments and conclusions based on systematic research and evidence as informed by the analytical framework.</p>

For group project mode, all team members are expected to be present for the presentation and contribute to the content and/or delivery of the presentation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The presentation is where the communication of the content of the research translates the content of an academic applied policy report to a more specific ‘briefing’ exercise that is designed to both inform and persuade. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The presentation should background the research but focus on (1) explaining the implications of the findings made in the Research Report and (2) converting the findings into either recommendations or learning for the client organisation. The content and delivery of the presentation must make a persuasive argument for implementing any recommended course of action. <em>The presentation should neither describe the research process itself nor simply summarise the written report</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Careful consideration needs to be given to the structure and focus of the presentation, and which key points of facts and evidence to include. There is no set format for presentations – students may use a variety of approaches and devices to convey their arguments, including audio or video clips – but all presentations must be supported by <em>a concise Slideshow of no more than 10 slides to be submitted to the panel at the conclusion of the presentation</em> for assessment.</p>

<p><b>Personal Reflections</b></p>
<p><strong>Word Length:</strong></p><p>750 words</p><p><strong>Course Weighting:</strong></p><p>10%</p><p><strong>Due Date:</strong></p><p>Two (2) weeks after Semester End Date</p><p><strong>Type:</strong></p><p>For both individual and group project modes this is an individual task</p><p><strong>Task Description and Guidance:</strong></p><p>After completing their Applied Policy Project students must submit a Personal Reflections document (the Reflections). The Reflections document is a critical component of ‘reflective practice’. It provides a structured opportunity to reflect on how concrete experiences during the project have helped both to enhance your understanding of academic concepts and research methods and their application, and to develop a better conception of your own personal work characteristics and work preferences. The Reflections is the primary means for assessing your engagement with career-literacy based professional development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Journal should address two key areas:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Project journal entries</em>. During the semester students will keep a regular reflective journal that briefly records key activities, interactions and experiences, and makes observations on how concepts and practices introduced in the classroom have helped to understand or interpret those activities, interactions and experiences. This could, for example, include analytical reflections on the alignment (or otherwise) between the theory and observed practice of policy, research and organisations. The entries should total approximately 300 words. This part of the Reflections can be presented in journal short entry format.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Reflecting on expectations</em>. Building on the observations made in the journal entries, the Reflections must also reflect on the student’s ‘baseline’ understanding of their personal characteristics, work behaviours, and professional orientation as set out in the Statement of Expectations prepared at the start of the course (see Assessment Task 1). The Reflections should make observations on how the project experience has helped to either confirm or challenge career orientation and future professional development, or how it can be applied in current professional activities. Where relevant, the Reflections should relate specific knowledge and skills application and/or development to the student’s ‘baseline’ understanding of their personal characteristics and work preferences. These reflections should total approximately 450 words. This part of the Journal can be presented in conventional essay format.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additional guidance on how to approach reflective writing tasks can be accessed here: <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/writing-assessment/reflective-writing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/writing-assessment/reflective-writing</u></a></p>

                    <h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
Academic integrity is a core part of our culture as a community of scholars. At its heart, academic integrity is about behaving ethically. This means that all members of the community commit to honest and responsible scholarly practice and to upholding these values with respect and fairness. The Australian National University commits to embedding the values of academic integrity in our teaching and learning. We ensure that all members of our community understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity. The ANU expects staff and students to uphold high standards of academic integrity and act ethically and honestly, to ensure the quality and value of the qualification that you will graduate with. The University has policies and procedures in place to promote academic integrity and manage academic misconduct. Visit the following <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/academic-honesty-plagiarism" target="_blank">Academic honesty & plagiarism website</a> for more information about academic integrity and what the ANU considers academic misconduct. The ANU offers a number of services to assist students with their assignments, examinations, and other learning activities. The <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/learning-development" target="_blank">Academic Skills and Learning Centre</a> offers a number of workshops and seminars that you may find useful for your studies.                                                <h2 id="onlinesubmission">Online Submission</h2>
The ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. While the use of Turnitin is not mandatory, the ANU highly recommends Turnitin is used by both teaching staff and students. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the ANU Online website.
                    <h2 id="hardcopysubmission">Hardcopy Submission</h2>
For some forms of assessment (hand written assignments, art works, laboratory notes, etc.) hard copy submission is appropriate when approved by the Associate Dean (Education). Hard copy submissions must utilise the Assignment Cover Sheet. Please keep a copy of tasks completed for your records.                                                <h2 id="latesubmission">Late Submission</h2>
<p>Late submission of assessment tasks are penalised at the rate of 5% of the possible marks available per working day or part thereof. Late submission of assessment tasks without an extension is not accepted after 10 working days after the due date, or on or after the date specified in the course outline for the return of the assessment item. Late submission is not accepted for take-home examinations.</p>                                                <h2 id="referencing-requirements">Referencing Requirements </h2>
