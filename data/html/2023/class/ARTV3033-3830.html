<p>In this course students will develop their creative research practice through experimentation with artistic methods, strategies, materials and concepts. Students will learn how to direct their ideas and existing knowledge and refine their skills, while identifying and articulating contextual links. The outcomes for this course will be the development and shaping of a personal methodology culminating in the creation of new work. A series of lectures from visiting artists, theorists, curators and scholars from various fields will introduce students to a range of ideas, contexts and methods of production.</p><p>Based on their own Independent Work Proposal (IWP), students will develop artistic approaches relevant to their area(s) of interest. This course encourages the students to self-direct their art practice. The aim of the course is for each student to develop their own framework, bringing together the skills and knowledge they have acquired to date.</p><p>A student’s participation in discussions around their project and their peers’ projects will be integral to the course. The course will provide a cross-disciplinary forum for critical and contextual discussions relevant to contemporary art practice. Students will be supported through group sessions across several disciplines as well as tutorials and discussions within the different Workshops.</p><p>Workplace Health and Safety instruction is an integral part of this course and will be handled within each Workshop.</p><p>This course is delivered by the following School of Art &amp; Design disciplines: Animation and Video, Painting, Photomedia, Printmedia and Drawing, and Sculpture and Spatial Practice.</p>

                                Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
                            </p>
<ol><li>demonstrate their knowledge of the concepts, processes, forms, materials and technologies relevant to their project;</li><li>develop and articulate an independent studio project;</li><li>experiment with concepts, objectives and appropriate processes by thinking creatively, critically and reflectively;</li><li>work independently and/or collaboratively in a studio environment in response to project demands; and</li><li>demonstrate their awareness of social, ethical, cultural, technological and environmental issues of creative practice, considering local and international perspectives.</li></ol>
                            <h2 id="research-led-teaching">Research-Led Teaching</h2>
<p>This course guides students through developing their own practice-led research methodology. The culmination in an independent work proposal requires exploring, thinking and consolidating a critical direction through a studio-based enquiry. Refined execution and considered presentation as well as experimental development all contribute defining the potential direction of the IWP. Students are asked to consistently re-examine the relationship between the manifestation of their own work its aspirations and the critical contexts they are researching. By affiliating their enquiry with a key research theme to be generated through the course, students are learning to position their own research within a wider contemporary field of creative and critical practice.&nbsp;</p>                                                    <h2 id="field-trips">Field Trips</h2>

<p><b>Folio of studio-based experimentation</b></p>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> 50%</p><p>By now you have planned, developed and executed a small studio investigation over 3 weeks. We anticipate this experiment will be highly generative: it could have been a conceptual failure, a technical success, over-ambitious, poorly planned or inspired you to take a new direction. The PowerPoint template offered a guide to help you plan and reflect on this process.</p><p><br></p><p>For Assessment Task Two, you must now plan and execute the next 8 weeks of your studio investigations. During this phase of the course, you will have the opportunity to move beyond a focus on a specific material or technical process, to consider the themes, ideas, problems and conceptual concerns that guide your work. What is the relationship of between form and content in your work? Is there a community of practice your work enters into a dialogue with? Where are the platforms, spaces and networks which might support your future practice?</p><p><br></p><p>In order to help guide this studio investigation, we offer the following prompts towards the generation of at least two new works.</p><p>During this time we will ask you to report back  the emerging thematic and conceptual concerns of your work to organise the cohort into cross-disciplinary thematic study groups. These groups, led by the teaching staff, will become spaces for sharing feedback and resources to support your progress. </p><p><br></p><p><u>PROMPT 1: Where are you?&nbsp;</u></p><ul><li>Consider your progress to date on your degree, and the works you have made. How would you describe your work? Is there a common sensibility, persistent themes, concerns or approaches you have so far been drawn to? Is there a community of practitioners you already identify with? Brainstorm and identify questions or keywords you might associate with your work.</li><li>Having generated a rough map of the concepts and concerns which animate your work, identify 1 scholarly reading and 2 artworks by two different artists that are of interest to you and relevant to your studio investigations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Map out your field of interest drawing on the text, artworks and key themes or questions – how do they complement or contradict each other? Where would you like to position your own work on this map? How might you explore these similarities and differences, how might you combine your interests together and respond to them critically?&nbsp;</li><li>Develop and deliver an artwork (or series of works) as your critical response.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><u>PROMPT 2: Where next? </u></p><ul><li>Analyse the outcomes of your response to <em>Where are you? </em>and reflect upon the strengths and weaknesses of the project. Did the results work out the way you had hoped? Revisit your decision making, think about how you resolved the work and consider what you would do differently. What questions does the work raise for you? What aspects feel most exciting and rich to pursue further? Or, has the experience opened a different approach?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Building on this analysis, create a work (or series of works) that further test the potential of material processes, presentation formats, concepts and critical contexts.&nbsp;This investigation and its outcomes will become the crux of your IWP Proposal: the what, the how, the why and a fuller sense of where next.&nbsp;</li><li>As you begin to draft your IWP Proposal (Week 7-11) continue to test the potential of your IWP through this studio-based enquiry.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Format: </strong>Use the Powerpoint template as a set of prompts to guide to document the development and delivery of your studio-based enquiry. The expectation is that you will be filling this in on a weekly basis and using it as a tool to support your ongoing reflection of your progress. <strong>Please note: This format does not preclude seeing the work installed real life for formative assessment in Weeks 9 &amp; 12. Participation and engagement will be assessed during whole class and group crits.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This task helps you identify your research interests and to develop a critical response through making artwork (Prompt 1). This critical response then becomes the basis for further iterative experimentation and extended studio investigations which test out ideas, processes and formats relevant to your IWP (Prompt 2). Whilst it is important to understand the initial <em>impetus</em> for the work, the aim is to develop a <em>process or studio methodology</em> in which artmaking itself becomes a means of exploring, thinking and consolidating your own focus and critical direction.</p>

<p><strong>Value:</strong> 30%</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of task:</strong></p><p>You have spent Semester 1 testing ideas, techniques, and exploring materials in the studio to help you define a set of parameters for your capstone project. Your Independent Work Proposal (IWP) is the culmination of your learning in Semester 1 and is a springboard for <a href="/2023/course/ARTV3035">ARTV3035</a> in Semester 2. It is a written proposal that communicates the key concepts, questions and methodologies which will shape a major body of work leading to the graduation exhibition.</p><p><br></p><p>The IWP should therefore clearly outline the anticipated future direction of your work, demonstrating your critical understanding of relevant contexts and discourses relevant to your practice. It should articulate any potential innovation in material and conceptual development, and a clear sense of your own working methodology ready for the final capstone project of your visual art degree. It will be developed in dialogue with your tutors, technical officers and peers. Full guidelines on the content, formatting and style of the text will be supplied on Wattle.</p><p><br></p><p>The submission of the IWP has two deadlines for assessment:</p><ul><li>A <strong>formative assessment point</strong>, where you are asked to submit an initial draft for feedback to <strong>Wattle by 23:55 on Friday 19th May</strong>.</li><li>A <strong>summative assessment point</strong>, where the completed IWP Proposal will be submitted to Wattle <strong>for final assessment by 13th June 2023 by 23:55</strong>.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Format:</strong> Written proposal of maximum 1500 words (excluding references).
