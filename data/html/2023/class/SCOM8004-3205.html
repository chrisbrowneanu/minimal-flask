<p>Students in this course develop their science communication skills in authentic science engagement settings, creating real-world impact and building networks and pathways to support career development. The course allows students to choose from a range of one-year intensive fieldwork placements at some of Australia’s leading science engagement organisations. Students explore the fundamental theory that underpins science communication in such settings, then apply it to deliver, evaluate and improve existing programs, develop novel programs and work on other suitable priorities of the fieldwork host – including working alongside and learning from their staff.</p><p><br></p><p>To see current fieldwork placement opportunities&nbsp;<a href="https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprogramsandcourses.anu.edu.au%2Fcourse%2FSCOM8004%23terms&amp;data=05%7C01%7Ccaroline.chapman%40anu.edu.au%7Ce0d46ad4c98a48a3b25208da85943749%7Ce37d725cab5c46249ae5f0533e486437%7C0%7C0%7C637969168865923972%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=S9AOoH1GpMGxONyAuVaR%2Fpe7jmGI39dGS0HcOXL%2BKKo%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">see the 'Class' tab</a>.

                                Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:

<ol><li>Implement, analyse and critique common activities of science communication organisations such as program design, delivery and evaluation.</li><li>Design, implement and critically evaluate novel science communication activities in real-world settings.</li><li>Demonstrate high-level proficiency and theoretical understanding of science communication techniques including presentation, facilitation, online and in-person engagement, and creation of equipment/resources.</li><li>Effectively and inclusively communicate science to audiences of varied ages and backgrounds, including youth, families, culturally and linguistically diverse communities and minoritised groups.</li><li>Identify, utilise and formulate bidirectional relationships between the theory and practice of science communication.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Theory informs practice; practice refines theory –</strong> Alongside the ‘practical’ fieldwork component that makes up much of 8004, students will also become familiar with the academic literature and research that underpins science shows, workshops and other formats used in science centres and traveling engagement programs. Research on science shows and outreach is sparse, so relevant theory is often drawn from research on formal education, informal science education, science communication, psychology and other disciplines.

<p>As the name suggests, Questacon fieldwork placements will involve work in the 'field' - either in public-facing activities at Questacon's two Canberra locations and/or travel locally or interstate to schools and public venues.

<p><b>Show Analysis and Development paper - Part 1: Analysis (introduction, literature/practice review, provisional method)</b></p>
<p><strong>Details of task: </strong>The ability to critique your own science communication practice, in this case science shows, and use your analysis to improve your programs is a critical skill. Your shows should be continually changing and improving – they should ‘evolve’. This evolution will happen formally through structured thinking such as this assessment and informally such as making tweaks, improvements or 'happy accidents' while in the field. Many past students tell us they wish they had more chance to develop and personalise their show - this assignment is the opportunity! This two-part assessment asks you to do a Show Analysis (part 1) and then use that to inform the Show Development (part 2).<u> If you learn multiple shows you may focus on just one, a few or all of them.</u> This assessment is completed individually.</p><p><br></p><p>The assessment is <strong>formatted in a similar way to an academic paper,</strong> providing an introduction to research. For an example of an academic paper that <em>roughly</em> follows this format see Walker, G. J., Stocklmayer, S. M., &amp; Grant, W. J. (2013). Science theatre: Changing South African students’ intended behaviour toward HIV AIDS. <em>International Journal of Science Education, Part B</em>, <em>3</em>(2), 101–120. NOTE this paper was produced as part of a PhD project so is more in-depth and research-oriented than what is expected from this assessment piece, however it should be helpful to illustrate the general approach of first understanding the context and theory that underpins your practice, then using that to understand its impacts and make improvements. Your paper, however, will be structured somewhat differently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Structure and key sections: </strong>The format is flexible and you can adapt sections, subheadings to suit your needs, however should include:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Show Analysis - this provides the theoretical and contextual foundation for your paper. It should:</p><ul><li><strong>Introduction </strong>- briefly <strong>introduce</strong> the wider context for your show</li><li><strong>Literature review</strong> - construct an <strong>argument</strong> that <strong>reviews the literature</strong> <strong>and your practice (shows)</strong> re the focus of your analysis and development - this should:</li><li class="ql-indent-1">start by <strong>broadly analysing your show</strong> by briefly discussing your practice (e.g. performances and training content, etc.) and how it fits together with the theory (i.e. the academic literature and scicom models). This may cover aspects of<em> content</em> (e.g. the science, demos, etc.) and/or <em>performance</em> (e.g. voice/body, dramatic aspects, etc.) and where they intersect - see below for some ideas.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">use this broad analysis to <strong>focus in on one or more key aspects </strong>to explore in more depth, including digging deeper and <strong>synthesising</strong> the literature - <u>NOTE this will form the basis for what you will develop in part 2 of the assignment, so put some thought into your priorities.</u></li><li class="ql-indent-1">draw conclusions from your literature/practice review, then <strong>identify priorities for development</strong>.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">it can help to think of the argument structure as a 'funnel' - you start by broadly looking at your show (top of the funnel), then use that broad analysis to identify/argue the key aspects you think need developing (funnel narrows), then from there your specific development priorities flow out (bottom of the funnel).</li><li><strong>Provisional method</strong> - outline a <strong>provisional</strong> <strong>method</strong> for implementing your development priorities - exactly what are they, how might you develop/improve the selected aspects, how will you measure the impact or know your improvements worked, etc.?</li></ul><p>You may identify several key aspects/development priorities, however it is best to focus on a few (e.g. 1-3) deeply, rather than many superficially.</p><p>As everyone will have different key aspects, <em>you'll need to do independent research to identify relevant academic papers </em>in addition to those covered in lectures. The Wattle folder is a great place to start and Graham is happy to share/discuss more on your specific areas (and he's keen to learn through new things you find too!).</p><p><br></p><p><u>IMPORTANT NOTE - when discussing your shows/practice in the Analysis, take into account both training/development experiences AND shows on tour. You will have limited public shows prior to submission, so make sure you are reflecting on your practice and MAKING NOTES during sessions at Questacon.</u></p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Show Development – this is the more experimental part of the paper where, based on your analysis, you take an evidence-based approach to improving your show - this should:</p><ul><li><strong>Method</strong> - outline a refined<strong> method</strong> <strong>for your development priorities </strong>- identify specific aspects to develop/improve, recap briefly the rationale for why you prioritised them, create a plan for improvement, and identify standard <em>and creative</em> indicators or ways to measure to your progress (i.e. data). Improvements may involve adding demos, developing performance techniques, sourcing or creating new demos/equipment, refining (not completely changing) the theme/focus of your show, etc.</li><li>Data may come in the form of structured or anecdotal audience observations by you or peers, peer/coordinator feedback, Questacon feedback surveys, talking to teachers, watching videos of performances, notes taken in the field, aspects indicated by the literature/theory, etc. - get creative! This data can be analaysed quantitatively or qualitatively. Your data may be more traditional (e.g. analysing themes in survey comments) or more innovative (e.g. measuring student enthusiasm through the number of hands up). Using several different types of data to measure a development will make your findings more nuanced and robust. Where possible, having a baseline (e.g. before you implemented you changes) allows you to better see the effects of your developments.</li><li><strong>Results</strong> - summarise your experience trialing the improvements and provide associated qualitative and/or quantitative data.</li><li><strong>Discussion</strong> - drawing on literature you used in the Analysis and new literature as relevant to your findings, discuss your findings. This could cover what worked, what didn't, why (in your opinion and with reference to the literature), etc. If you have findings that speak back to the theory, e.g. confirm/refute/develop ideas in the literature or place them in new contexts, this is the place to close the theory-practice loop.</li><li><strong>Conclusion</strong> - what does all this mean for your practice/shows and those of others; what are the specific things we should note or do going forward?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PLAN AHEAD! The structure of this assignment means you need to work on it over a period of time to produce a quality outcome. It is recommended you begin drafting, researching and ESPECIALLY TAKING NOTES during training, lectures and shows - not just before its due.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Below are just some key aspects of <em>content </em>and<em> performance</em> to think about and improve, but you may feel others are relevant too. The focus/weighting will depend a lot on your particular show:</p><ul><li>Enthusiasm, immediacy, humour and audience ‘connection’</li><li>Emotional engagement and the role of different emotions (e.g. surprise)</li><li>Relevance to the audience</li><li>Inclusive and cross-cultural science communication</li><li>Use of clear, accurate explanations with appropriate scientific concepts, explanations, language and performance for the particular audience</li><li>Show structure/storyline and connections between different segments</li><li>Use of props and execution of demonstrations</li><li>Audience interaction (questions, call and response, volunteers, etc.)</li><li>Use of voice (clarity, projection, tone, volume, modulation, etc.), facial expressions, body language and movement on stage</li><li>Your personal touches; what makes the show unique.</li></ul><p>It is strongly recommended you make preliminary notes during tour while show experiences are fresh in your mind. <em>Notes taken directly after shows will be priceless.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Marking Criteria</u></strong></p><p><strong>Both:</strong></p><ul><li>Fully integrate academic literature throughout (not just a token reference or generic paragraph at the end), consultation with peers/experts and other relevant sources to support the analysis and development – make links between theory and practice.</li><li>Be neatly formatted, written in clear and concise language, have excellent spelling, punctuation and grammar, clear structuring and signposting, and include pictures/photos, diagrams and figures that enhance communication.</li><li>Synthesise, bring together and triangulate evidence (use multiple sources of evidence to support a common conclusion) to create strong, structured, logical arguments.</li><li>Show evidence of independent literature research, expert consultation and other efforts to create a broad evidence base and make sense of your findings.</li><li>Use specific examples from the shows to support statements and illustrate ideas.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Show Analysis</strong></p><p>To be eligible for a pass on this assignment your Analysis must:</p><ul><li>Be 2000 words long, excluding your final reference list (note for all assessments, word limits have 10% wiggle room and you may include background/supplementary information - but never key info - as appendices that don't count towards the word limit).</li></ul><p>Overall, your Analysis should ideally:</p><ul><li>Address the structure and key sections points listed above – including insights from theory/literature.</li><li>Consider a range of show content and performance aspects, but craft an argument that focuses in on those most relevant to your show/development.</li><li>Create a well structured, easy to follow argument that starts broad, focuses in, and ends with your development priorities - these should flow smoothly and logically from your reflections and literature review.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Word limit: 2000</p><p>Value: 20%</p><p>Due: 20 April</p><p>Estimated return date: approximately two weeks later</p><p>Submission: via Wattle</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>If you have robust data, a good theoretical foundation, and interesting findings, you might like to consider trying to publish your Analysis and Development as a short academic paper (after receiving feedback), e.g. </u></strong><a href="https://jcom.sissa.it/jcom/help/practiceInsight.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>https://jcom.sissa.it/jcom/help/practiceInsight.jsp</u></strong></a><strong><u>.

<p><b>Work Placement 1: Reflections</b></p>
<p><strong>Details of task: </strong>During your Questacon placements you’ll get to work with professional teams at Questacon. Tasks may include to shadow and assist their team, co-deliver programs, develop new content, and generally contribute to Questacon's science communication activity. A key part of the placement is applying science communication theory and insights from the literature and staff at Questcaon in practice - as placements are unique you'll need to take the lead in finding theory/literature relevant to your particular placement. More info on placements and allocation to them will be provided by Questacon. This task asks you to reflect on your <strong><u>initial second semester</u></strong> placement in three forum posts. <strong>Posts are completed individually (even if you are working in a team placement).</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Exactly what you reflect on is somewhat open, but you should aim to fuse your practical experiences at Questacon with deeper insights from your own thinking, the academic literature and theory associated with the course, and/or wider science communication or associated areas. It’s suggested you look for broader patterns/themes in your placement/practice, rather than focusing narrowly on one experience.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>These posts are an opportunity to document ideas from science communication theory and insights from the experts at Questacon into your work placement as you go - a key thing you will need to report on in the Work Placement Presentation. </strong>Please see the folder on wattle for papers that may be useful; papers on the <a href="/2023/course/SCOM6007">SCOM6007</a> wattle page may also be useful for some placements - you will also need to do your own research and/or ask leads from Q and ANU. Make the most of the expert team at Q - to reference them, cite it as a 'personal communication'.</p><p><br></p><p>The key idea is to bring theory and practice together in a more personal, reflective way that will make you and Questacon more effective communicators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Marking Criteria</u></p><p>To be eligible for a pass on this assignment you must:</p><ul><li>Make three posts spaced over your <strong><u>first</u></strong> second semester placement – one towards the start, one in the middle, and one at the end. While overall timing is flexible to accommodate your Questacon activity, please see the requirements of when to post during your placement below.</li><li>Post a 400-500 word written post.</li><li>Comment meaningfully on at least two posts of other students.</li></ul><p>Overall, your posts should ideally:</p><ul><li>Combine deep insights on your own or others' practice at Questacon with relevant theory and literature.</li><li>Find broader patterns or principles in your practice that can be applied to other contexts, and highlight their relevance to peers and Questacon staff.</li><li>Have clear recommendations or outcomes from your reflection and apply them in practice going forward.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Length: 3 posts / 400-500 words per post</p><p>Value: 15%</p><p>Due: spaced over your <strong><u>first</u></strong> second semester placement - beginning (after two full days of work), middle (the middle time of your placement + - 1 day) and end (within five days of finishing)</p><p>Estimated return date: end of semester 2 (if you would like earlier feedback contact Graham, the diversity in placement timings make progressive marking tricky)</p><p>Submission: link for Wattle online discussion forum will be supplied</p>

<p><b>Work Placement Presentation</b></p>
<p><strong>Details of task: </strong>This assignment asks you to reflect and report on your Questacon work placement(s), exploring both logistical/practical and conceptual/literature-based aspects. Depending on your placement(s) structure, you may want to do it in two parts (e.g. for two very different placements) or all together (e.g. two linked placements). This is formatted as a round-table/seminar type presentation so Questacon and ANU staff and your peers can learn from your experience. This presentation is done individually. <strong>To be successful in this presentation, you will need to have kept detailed notes on your placement experience as you go.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Your presentation (including a PowerPoint file or similar) should include:</p><ul><li>A detailed description of what you did and its aims, including background on the Questacon team and context (don't assume people are familiar with the detail of what the Q team does).</li><li>A detailed description of the outcomes it produced. Wherever possible this should include actual examples (e.g. an excerpt from a show, an exhibit/activity you created, evaluation findings, etc.).</li><li>A review of literature and other experts sources that supports (1) the design/methodology/approach/etc. you used (i.e. what you did), and (2) to better understand its outcomes (i.e. how does the literature/theory help understand the outcomes?).</li><li>Analysis of any feedback, data, anecdotes, observations, etc. from audiences, Questacon staff or elsewhere that show effectiveness, ideas for improvement, or other aspects. You are not required to formally evaluate your project unless that was part of the Questacon brief.</li><li>Building on the literature review, analysis/discussion of how your work placement fits into contemporary science communication theory/practice. This may cover links to wider science communication models/concepts, how your experience confirms/refutes/expands ideas in the literature, recommendations for science communication practice based on your experience, etc. (similar to the Discussion section in an academic paper).</li><li>Specific recommendations for the Questacon team and project.</li><li>What skills and knowledge you gained from placement, including reflecting on what you think are the most important underlying transferable skills.</li><li>A reference list (this may include sources used in the presentation and elsewhere in the placement).</li><li>Active discussion and Q&amp;A to allow the substance and outcomes of the placement to be fleshed out collectively - this may include questions you have for the Q team.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Marking Criteria</u></strong></p><p>To be eligible for a pass on this assignment your presentation must:</p><ul><li>Present as per the length below and make best efforts for active discussion and Q&amp;A.</li><li>Submit your PowerPoint or equivalent.</li><li>Demonstrate you completed and were effective in your placement(s).</li><li>Incorporate academic literature and a reference list.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, your presentation should ideally:</p><ul><li>Include the sections above and any others specific to your placement, giving the audience a detailed idea of your experiences and outcomes.</li><li>Be presented in a clear, engaging, professional and personable manner, showing evidence of planning and rehearsal.</li><li>Include illustrative examples of placement experience and outcomes.</li><li>Include physical or screen based visual communication such as props, exhibits, diagrams, video, pictures, tables and/or figures that enhance communication.</li><li>Be neatly formatted, written in clear and concise language, have excellent spelling, punctuation, grammar and structure.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Length: individuals – 30 minutes presentation / 15 minutes discussion</p><p>Value: 25%</p><p>Due: TBC early November</p><p>Estimated return date: 1-2 weeks later</p><p>Submission: presentation in-person / PowerPoint file or similar via Wattle <u>(please submit on the day of presentation)</u></p>
