                            </p>
<ol><li>demonstrate an advanced control of technique, performance accuracy, and subtlety of musical expression within an awareness of musical textures, style, and character of the music being performed;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>demonstrate musicianship and performance presentation that includes high level imagination, confident artistic expression, and an understanding of the emotional intent of the music, through effective communication with an audience;</li><li>demonstrate the ability to propose a research question and explore the question leading to a performance outcome. The student will be able to explain this process and outcome orally or in writing;</li><li>provide immediate verbal feedback to a range of performers on their live concert performance; and</li><li>demonstrate their continuous development as ensemble performers.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Re-use of Repertoire</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It is an ANU policy that students can not be assessed on the same material more than once. This means that students may not submit for any assessment a work that a) has been used for a solo assessment in either the current semester or an earlier semester (excepting use in Concert Practice), or b) has already been used for an ensemble assessment in either the current semester or an earlier semester.</p><p><br></p><p>However, in certain instances material changes to a composition may render it virtually a ‘different’ work from an interpretative perspective, such as substantial changes to instrumentation (i.e., from a large ensemble setting to a solo) or style (i.e., from an up-tempo setting to a ballad).</p><p><br></p><p>If you believe the re-use of repertoire may fall into this later category, and if you wish to present a case to the Performance Convener, please use fill out the form found on your course Wattle site.</p>                                                    <h2 id="class-schedule">Class Schedule</h2>

<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>
<p>Marks that are allocated during Semester are to be considered provisional until formalised by the College examiners meeting at the end of each Semester. If appropriate, some moderation of marks might be applied prior to final results being released.</p>                                                <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>Performing live in a concert can only be learned through actually participating in a concert, not only as a performer, but also as an audience member. As an audience member you learn about live performance from observing a range of live performances and providing live feedback to a range of performers on their live performance. Having an audience changes the dynamic and so it is essential that an audience is present for the live performance. The absence of an audience has a negative impact on the concert practice experience. As such, in order to pass this course students must, unless they have a relevant medical certificate, participate in at least 80% of Concert Practice time by active listening within each performance and offering constructive feedback based on this active listening when called upon to do so.</p>                                                <h2 id="examination">Examination(s)</h2>

<p><b>Ensemble Assessment</b></p>
<p><strong>Details of task:&nbsp;</strong>Ensemble participation and performance are integral components of Music Performance 1 – 6. In this module, students learn to perform in an ensemble, building team skills and rehearsal techniques, while exploring musical styles, developing artistic expression and communication through group performance. Through their rehearsals, performances and reflection upon the interaction and accomplishments of their ensemble peers, students will gain insights into ‘best practice’ in ensemble music preparation.</p><p><br></p><p>For all students taking <a href="/2023/course/MUSI1102">MUSI1102</a> Performance 2, the Ensemble component (20%) of this course will be delivered via one of the School’s suite of Flagship Ensembles. Students should confirm their ensemble with SoMAD by the end of week 2 of the semester. For further information about the Flagship ensembles, please consult the&nbsp;ANU School of Music Performance Handbook, which is available in .pdf format on the Music Performance Wattle website.</p><p>Please note that ANU Chamber Choir (Wednesday 4.00 – 6.00pm in Big Band Room) is a compulsory ensemble for classical voice singers enrolled in Music Performance 1 and 2.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Value:&nbsp;</strong>20% of the total grade. The Ensemble component comprises:</p><p>1. Ensemble director’s mark: 10% of the total grade.</p><p>2. Ensemble performance mark: The examiners’ averaged mark for the ensemble’s performance will contribute 10% of the total grade. A panel of two examiners (with at least one panel member being a member of the ANU School of Music Faculty) will assess the ensemble’s performance given in week 12 (the final teaching week of the semester), or in a performance throughout the semester.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Assessment criteria – Ensemble Director’s mark:</strong></p><p><strong>Preparation</strong>: Preparation incorporates the practical musical groundwork undertaken by the student prior to weekly rehearsals, including time spent researching background material on the scores/charts and composers, note learning and polishing, the addition of correct bowings in parts (if applicable), and translations of foreign language material (if applicable). It also incorporates the student's level of personal organisation, which includes punctuality to rehearsals and performances, and consistently bringing the correct scores/charts to rehearsal.</p><p><strong>Interaction within the ensemble</strong>:&nbsp;The collective strength of an ensemble is dependent on the consistent contribution of each individual member. That is, each player/singer in the ensemble carries the ultimate responsibility for the performance outcome, which is built upon the cohesive interaction and verbal/cognitive and musical input of ensemble members, their positive interaction with the ensemble director, and capacity to engage constructively with fellow players/singers throughout the rehearsal period.</p><p><strong>Creative individuality</strong>:&nbsp;The level of ensemble members’ musical intuition and creative individuality contributes to the overall quality of the ensemble, and to the level of excellence evident within the ensemble’s performance outcomes.</p><p><strong>Musicianship</strong>:&nbsp;Skills in musicianship—for example, a student’s aural skills in recognising intervals and chord qualities, rhythmic and melodic proficiencies in sight-reading, accuracy of intonation, and a well-developed musical memory and aptitude for dictation and improvisation—form the foundations of high-quality ensemble performance.</p><p><strong>Affinity for performance</strong>:&nbsp;The ensemble director will evaluate each student’s abilities and affinity for performance during a concert presented by the ensemble for a live audience. Many musicians experience the phenomenon of live performance in contrasting ways, and for most, performing live and dealing with performance nerves are part of a steep learning curve. Through application, training and experience in live performance, many students develop their affinity for the 'craft' of performance, where collective skills are honed to a high level, allowing confident interaction with the audience, and assured, well-prepared interpretation of the musical materials.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Assessment criteria – Ensemble performance:</strong></p><ul><li>Quality of the ensemble’s intonation, articulation, languages and diction (if appropriate).</li><li>Quality of communication and interaction evident within the ensemble, the level of confidence displayed during the performance, and the apparent sophistication of collective artistic expression and musicianship displayed by the ensemble.</li><li>Appropriateness of chosen repertoire, and the level of musical and artistic variety evident within the ensemble’s performance.</li><li>Quality, consistency and variety of the ensemble’s tone, timbre, and projection, as well as the dynamic contrast, blend and balance manifest within the ensemble.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Due date:&nbsp;</strong>Performance assessed during the semester, or in Week 12&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Value:&nbsp;</strong>20%</p><p><strong>Presentation requirements:&nbsp;</strong>Students are required to:</p><ul><li>attend and contribute to weekly rehearsals with their nominated Flagship Ensemble.</li><li>participate in performances given by their nominated Flagship Ensemble throughout the semester.</li></ul><p><strong>Ensemble: </strong>Performing in an ensemble can only be learned through actually participating in an ensemble, and the absence of an ensemble member has a negative impact on the ability not only of themselves but also of each of the other ensemble members to continuously develop as ensemble performers. As such, in order to pass this course students must, unless they have a relevant medical certificate, participate in at least 80% of ensemble rehearsal time.</p>

In some cases student end users will be required to register an account with the database licensor and submit personal information, including their: first name; last name; ANU email address; and other information.<br>In cases where student end users are asked to submit ‘content’ to a database, such as an assignment or short answers, the database licensor may only use the student’s ‘content’ in accordance with the terms of service – including any (copyright) licence the student grants to the database licensor. Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.<br>If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>
