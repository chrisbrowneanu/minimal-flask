<p>This course introduces students to the theoretical frameworks, empirical cases, policy instruments, and cutting-edge debates in the field of international law from an International Relations perspective.&nbsp; This is not a course in international law. Rather, the course goes beyond the conventional black letter approach and focuses on the political contexts, causes, and consequences of international law, thereby bridging international politics and international law. The course is structured in three parts. First, we will focus on the different theoretical perspectives in International Relations for understanding international law, such as realist, liberal, and constructivist approaches. Second, the course will examine the general principles of international law, including actors of international law, the creation and sources of international law, international law interpretation, the relationship between international and national law, and the problem of compliance. Third, we will examine the interrelationships between international politics and international law in several specialized areas of international law, such as human rights, the environment, international criminal justice, trade, and/or the use of force.</p>

<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>
<p>Marks that are allocated during Semester are to be considered provisional until formalised by the College examiners meeting at the end of each Semester. If appropriate, some moderation of marks might be applied prior to final results being released.</p>                                                                            <h2 id="examination">Examination(s)</h2>
<p>A take-home essay final exam will be administered during the examination period. Specifically, the take-home essay exam paper will be released to you via Wattle (the “Assessments” section) at 2:30 pm, 2 November 2023, and your take-home essays will be due by 2:30 pm, 9 November 2023 at Wattle Turnitin.

<p><b>Research Question Proposal</b></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Due date</strong>: Monday 21 August 2023, 11:00 am. <strong>Value</strong>: 10%</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Word limit:</strong> <strong>900 words of text</strong> in length, <strong>excluding</strong> footnotes (or endnotes), the references, tables, figures, appendices, and the cover sheet, if any, from the word count. Per ANU College of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, an assignment must not deviate from the prescribed word limit either up or down by more than 10%. In other words, the acceptable word count for your paper is minimum 810 and maximum 990 words of text.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Details of task:</strong> You must write a research question proposal on a topic of your choice and relating to the themes of the course. In your research paper (your second assessment task), you will write about the causes of an international law phenomenon by making a theoretically-informed argument and supporting it with empirical evidence. Your research question proposal (your first assessment task) is designed to help you choose and finalise the research question for your research paper as early as possible, so that you can focus your efforts on the research paper (worth 40% of your final course grade).</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">To help you avoid basic mistakes, here are some requirements for your topic choice. (1) You must select a major <strong>multilateral treaty</strong> that <strong>currently exists</strong>. For instance, the Kyoto Protocol (in full, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) is unacceptable for your paper since it no longer exists. (2) You <strong>cannot</strong> write about customary international law, so-called soft law (that is, non-binding international declarations, recommendations, and guidelines like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), an intergovernmental organisation, or a nongovernmental organisation as your paper topic. However, you may analyse and discuss an intergovernmental or nongovernmental organisation in your paper if this political actor plays a key role in your story of an international law phenomenon. (3) You <strong>cannot</strong> write about <u>the United States and the Paris Agreement (including the Glasgow Climate Pact)</u> because of the ongoing controversy over its validity under the U.S. Constitution (see Week 5 lecture for more details). (4) You <strong>cannot</strong> write about a futuristic, predictive, philosophical, or ethical topic since it is not amenable to empirical testing (see Week 1 lecture for more details). (5) Because our course is in International Relations (IR) and political science, you <strong>cannot</strong> write what is commonly called a legal case analysis/note in the College of Law, that is, a textual analysis that primarily concentrates on the legal reasoning of conflicting parties and the ruling of an international judicial body (for example, the International Court of Justice) in an international legal dispute.

What is your research question in one interrogative sentence? Your research question should still contain (i) the name of the international treaty of your interest, (ii) the country and time period of your interest, and (iii) the specific aspect of the treaty phenomenon you focus on (that is, whether you focus on that country’s treaty negotiation position, signing, ratification, non-ratification, compliance, noncompliance, and/or withdrawal).</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">(2)&nbsp;A section describing the dependent variable (that is, the outcome to be explained) and justifying your case selection (that is, why you choose both the topic and your specific country case including the specific time period).</p><p class="ql-align-justify">What are you trying to explain?

Per ANU College of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, an assignment must not deviate from the prescribed word limit either up or down by more than 10%. In other words, the acceptable word count for your paper is minimum 2,250 and maximum 2,750 words of text.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Details of task:</strong> You must write a research paper on <strong>the same research question</strong> that you proposed to answer in your Research Question Proposal, utilising IR theories of international law you have learned in our course and conducting a rigorous empirical case study as a theory application exercise.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Please <strong>note</strong> that (1) after the research question proposal, your topic choice is <strong>final</strong> and <strong>cannot</strong> be changed; (2) you must use and apply <strong>one of realist, liberal, or constructivist IR theories of international law</strong> (as will be covered in class) <strong>as your theoretical perspective</strong>; and (3) you must <strong>explicitly address the counter-arguments from the other two competing IR theories</strong> that you did not choose in (2).</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Your research paper should include the following sections, which are based on the typical structure of a good political science journal article:</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">(1) An introduction</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;What is your research question? Why is it important? What is your thesis in one sentence?</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">(2) A section on your theoretical explanation</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;You need to have your own argument and it must be informed by one of the three IR theories of international law (that is, realism, liberalism, and constructivism). Specifically, what is your main argument? What existing literatures do you build on in developing your argument? What is your theoretical story in detail? For instance, you may want to address the following issues, although these are not prescriptive but suggestive or illustrative: who are the main political actors in your explanation?; are they primarily driven by material interests or identities and norms?; how do those actors cause the international law outcome of your interest?</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">For more advice on writing a good IR theory, please read Van Evera (1997, 7-27 (para. 2)) recommended for Week 1.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">(3) A section on your empirical analysis and findings</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The application of your theory to your empirical case. Please <strong>note</strong> that usually the best research papers have separate sections on theory and empirical analysis, rather than mixing them up.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Also, you <strong>must</strong> explicitly and effectively deal with the counter-arguments from the other two competing IR theories (that is, the two theories that you did not choose in section (2)), and defend why your preferred theory is still superior: You must address <strong>each</strong> of the <strong>two</strong> counter-arguments as part of your empirical analysis.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">For more advice on testing your theory with an empirical case, please read Van Evera (1997, 27 (para. 3)-48) recommended for Week 1.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">(4) A conclusion</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Re-state your main argument. Also, explain why the reader should care about your findings. In the conclusion you may also briefly address policy or normative implications of your findings if you wish to.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The aim of this research paper is to demonstrate knowledge of the different IR theories of international law, and to connect these theories to a sophisticated empirical analysis of an international law phenomenon. In other words, you are writing about international law by making a theoretically-informed argument and supporting it with empirical evidence – this is the basis of a good research paper in the social science.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Due to the Programs and Courses webpage's word limit, not all the information on Research Paper I wish to offer for you can be displayed in this Class Summary.
