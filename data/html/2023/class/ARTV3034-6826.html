<p>In this course students will extend and consolidate their creative research practice through refinement and development of artistic methods, strategies, materials and concepts. Students will direct their ideas and existing knowledge and further their skills, while identifying and articulating contextual links. This course will enable the realisation of a personal methodology culminating in the creation of original work suitable for exhibition. A series of lectures will provide students with range of contextual, historical and theoretical references in relation to contemporary art practices.</p><p>Based on their own Independent Work Proposal (IWP), students will explore artistic approaches relevant to their area(s) of interest. Students will expand their skills in writing and speaking about their work, and in presenting work in a professional setting. Students will learn how to research and articulate the context of their work, including theoretical, historical and critical frameworks.</p><p>A student’s continued participation in discussions around their project and their peers’ projects will be integral to the course. The course will provide a cross-disciplinary forum for critical and contextual discussions relevant to contemporary art practice. Students will be supported through group sessions across several disciplines as well as tutorials and discussions within the different Workshops.</p><p>At this level students will apply appropriate Workplace Health and Safety practices.</p><p>This course is delivered by the following School of Art &amp; Design disciplines: Painting, Photography and Media Arts, Printmedia and Drawing, and Sculpture and Spatial Practice.</p>

                                Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
                            </p>
<ol><li>demonstrate skill in executing an original independent project suitable for exhibition;</li><li>evaluate concepts and processes through creative, critical and reflective thinking;</li><li>clearly articulate the concepts and techniques underpinning the project;</li><li>work responsibly in a studio environment, either independently or collaboratively, in response to project demands; and</li><li>demonstrate comprehensive awareness of social, ethical, cultural, technological and environmental issues of creative practice, considering local and international perspectives.</li></ol>
                            <h2 id="research-led-teaching">Research-Led Teaching</h2>
<p>In extended independent work proposal students further develop their own practice-led research methodology and consolidate their knowledge and skills through completing an Independent Project. Refined execution and considered presentation as well as experimental development all contribute reviewing the IWP and refining the Independent Project. Students are asked to consistently re-examine the relationship between the manifestation of their own work, its aspirations and the critical contexts they are researching. Supported by the thematic group structure, students expand their learning to position their own research within a wider contemporary field of creative and critical practice.&nbsp;</p>                                                                            <h2 id="additional-course-costs">Additional Course Costs</h2>

<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>
<p>Marks that are allocated during Semester are to be considered provisional until formalised by the College examiners meeting at the end of each Semester.

<p>Participation is assessed as part of this course. It is included in Task 2 as participation plays an important part in the development and refinement of your Independent Project and helps you hone a more critical approach. The standard of participation to aspire to is generous and insightful, sharing with the class or your group highly relevant examples of artist, ideas, parallel investigations, readings and cultural contexts. Please commit to building the skills to provide your peers with well-considered feedback in critique. Be a good listener. Whilst conversations need to be rigorous and opinions are very welcome, each contribution needs to be respectful and thoughtfully delivered. Be each other's best resource and make class and group engagement exciting and dynamic! </p>

<p><strong>Value:</strong> 20%</p><p><strong>Details of task:</strong> The Independent Work Proposal provides the basis for this course. In Weeks 1-3 you will review your written IWP and reflect upon the works made in&nbsp;<a href="/2023/course/ARTV3033">ARTV3033</a>. These first few weeks are the time to further refine and define your own working methodology, the aims of your project and to better understand the requirements of your chosen formats. &nbsp;In Weeks 4-5 you will present an Independent Work Proposal Review and 9 Week Plan in class. This is an opportunity for peer and lecturer feedback on your proposal and plan. You will need to briefly account for changes made to your IWP and the ways you have conducted your investigations so far in Semester 2. </p><p><strong>Format: </strong>Prepare a 7-minute power-point presentation to be delivered in class. Final slide to include a bibliography, all quotes and references must be fully footnoted using the Chicago style of referencing. Footnotes and bibliography must be formatted precisely using the Chicago style.

<p><b>Independent project: Final Outcomes, Development and Research</b></p>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> 60%</p><p><strong>Details of task: </strong>Undertake your Independent Project using your Independent Work Proposal Review and 9 -week plan for guidance. Extend the methodology for independent practice that you developed in <a href="/2023/course/ARTV3033">ARTV3033</a> to enable you to create ambitious critically positioned and well-executed artwork. As <a href="/2023/course/ARTV3033">ARTV3033</a> was a springboard for this course, <a href="/2023/course/ARTV3034">ARTV3034</a> consolidates the learning of your Visual Art degree as a whole and culminates in outcomes that are of a quality required for public presentation (aka Grad Show and beyond). Class activities including analysis of artworks, structured critiques, groups discussions and 1:1 tutorials all support the independent development, refinement and critical approach of your project. Participation is an important part of cohort and culture building extending your thinking and understanding of practice by being engaged in the work of your peers.</p><p><strong>Format: </strong>For assessment, students install their final outcomes along with associated formal development (sketches, tests, models, prototypes, screenshots of work in progress, documentation of trial run performances/events etc) and supporting further research or analysis ( analogue or digital visual diaries with pages most relevant to the rubric highlighted, including notes on further texts or analysis not covered by Task 1 or Task 3, mind maps, key notes from tutorials, analysis of own work as part of working methodology etc). The development material and further research takes the examiner into your decision making and provides a clear sense of your level of investment in your own project- how did you arrive at your final outcomes? What experiments did you undertake? What problem solving was necessary? What consolidation of ideas, elements within the work or aims was required? How did you analyse the successes of your artwork as your project progressed? Participation is assessed on an ongoing basis through class activities. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Please refer to Wattle for more extensive Independent Project guidelines and resources</strong></p>
