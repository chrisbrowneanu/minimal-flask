<p>This course surveys the main issues of Southeast Asian security, giving due attention to traditional concerns with interstate conflict as well as non-traditional themes like the economy and the quality of democratic governance. It also provides a grounding in the Cold War-era conflicts that shaped the region as we know it today. The central focus, however, is on contemporary internal armed conflict rooted in processes of state formation and state decay (for instance, ethnic conflict in Myanmar, separatist violence in Indonesia or the attempts to create an autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao in the Philippines). Key internal conflicts affecting the human security of millions of Southeast Asians, as well as near neighbours like Australia, will be analysed in their unique historical and cultural context, and related to cross-cutting questions with broad inter-disciplinary significance negotiating views from above and below, from inside and outside.&nbsp;  </p>

                <td>DECOLONISATION AND THE COLD WAR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 6 March This week we look at the process of state formation in Southeast Asia after the Second World War. The end of the war triggered a process of decolonisation in the region, which led to the emergence of nation states as the main players in Southeast Asian security. As with most international developments at that time, the evolution of Southeast Asia’s regional security system was heavily influenced by the Cold War, with both the United States and the Soviet Union trying to pull the region to their sides.

                <td>ASEAN’s CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 13 March Today we discuss the emergence of ASEAN as a key player in Southeast Asian security. While often detracted as marginal and ineffective, ASEAN has developed into an important forum to discuss security matters that affect all Southeast Asian states. In order to understand the way ASEAN functions today, we analyse the circumstances of its creation as well as its involvement in contemporary security problems in the region. In the lecture, the organization's attempt to address the post-coup conflicts in Myanmar will serve as a case study of ASEAN's abilities and deficiencies.

After initially reluctant to act, governments in the region understood after the Bali attack in 2002 – which was one of the largest terrorist incidents in modern history – that they needed to increase their counter-terrorism capacities. In this week's discussions, we try to explore the motivations of terrorist groups and individuals, and analyze the impact of counter-terrorism measures on Southeast Asia's security and political landscape.

For decades, militants groups in the Muslim area of Mindanao have fought for independence (or, alternatively, more autonomy) from the mostly Catholic Philippines. Similarly, Islamist activists and cells have launched a violent campaign for independence from the predominantly Buddhist kingdom of Thailand. We look at the various attempts to resolve these conflicts, and try to understand why these efforts have so far been unsuccessful in the case of Southern Thailand, and peace arrangements remain highly volatile in Mindanao.

On the one hand, we will discuss Malaysia, which has traditionally tried to contain ethnic tensions by integrating all groups into a multi-ethnic government alliance – whether in the long-ruling Barisan Nasional or other post-2018 formations. Myanmar, on the other hand, has used a wide range of strategies (few of them successful), ranging from military force, cease fire agreements, peace negotiations and informal arrangements with local drug and war lords. These conflicts have now fused with the fight against the junta that took charge (again) in 2021.

<p><b>Tutorial Participation (10%)</b></p>
<p>You will be assessed on your tutorial participation. The assessment is primarily based on the quality of your contributions in class (and therefore, not simply on the frequency of your contributions and/or attendance.) After each tutorial, you will receive a mark. Absence is marked as zero, unless docomentation on justifiable absence is provided. At the end of the semester, the average of your eight best marks achieved throughout the semester will be your total mark for tutorial participation. In order to prepare for the tuorials, it is essential that you have read the required reading and attended/listened to the lecture of that week. The better you are prepared through reflecting on these materials (and, optionally, additional material you researched yourself), the more effectively you will be able to engage in class, and the better your mark will be.</p><p><br></p><p>For students who feel uncomfortable with public speaking in class or who face participation hurdles due to the specific circumstances created by the pandemic, the course convener accepts brief written commentaries on the main reading of the respective week as a substitute for a contribution made in class. Students who wish to make use of this opportunity should send this brief commentary to the course convener within one week of the tutorial for which the student seeks a substitute participation mark. However, such students should write to the course convener at the beginning of the semester and explain their reasons for not being able to contribute in class. Unavailability due to work commitments or similar reasons are not acceptable - the mechanism of substituting oral contributions with brief commentaries is designed to accommodate students who can't contribute in class because of the barriers mentioned above, not because of pragmatic timing issues or matters of convenience.</p>

<p>Academic integrity is a core part of the ANU culture as a community of scholars. The University’s students are an integral part of that community. The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2021L00997#_Toc35619227" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academic integrity principle</a> commits all students to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support, academic integrity, and to uphold this commitment by behaving honestly, responsibly and ethically, and with respect and fairness, in scholarly practice.</p><p><br></p><p>The University expects all staff and students to be familiar with the academic integrity principle, the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/about/governance/legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Integrity Rule 2021,</a> the <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Policy: Student Academic Integrity</a> and <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477150" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Procedure: Student Academic Integrity</a>, and to uphold high standards of academic integrity to ensure the quality and value of our qualifications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Academic Integrity Rule 2021 is a legal document that the University uses to promote academic integrity, and manage breaches of the academic integrity principle. The Policy and Procedure support the Rule by outlining overarching principles, responsibilities and processes. The Academic Integrity Rule 2021 commences on 1 December 2021 and applies to courses commencing on or after that date, as well as to research conduct occurring on or after that date. Prior to this, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L02025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Misconduct Rule 2015</a> applies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The University commits to assisting all students to understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity. All coursework students must complete the online Academic Integrity Module (Epigeum), and Higher Degree Research (HDR) students are required to complete research integrity training.
