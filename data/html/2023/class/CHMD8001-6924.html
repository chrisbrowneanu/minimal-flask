                                Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
                            </p>
<ol><li>plan and implement a research project in the area of culture, health and medicine using non-field-based methods;</li><li>critically and reflectively analyse a body of cognate literature in culture, health and medicine and prioritise, synthesise and order such a body of work;</li><li>identify and communicate core ideas to a non-specialist audience;</li><li>develop a cogent piece of sustained scholarly writing on a topic.</li></ol>

<p>This course focusses on producing a piece of translational research. Together, each student and supervisor will be exploring the requirements of their chosen structure (eg policy paper, academic article, essay) and the audience for whom the piece is written. The structure of the course involves peer interaction in three tutorials, modelling writing circles, as well as individual tutorials working with each student to optimise the learning experience. We will be utilising the expertise of the library staff to improve the academic skills of each student in their own discipline and area of interest.</p>                                                    <h2 id="field-trips">Field Trips</h2>

Abstract includes a research question(s) and describes the process of gathering information from multiple, research-based sources. Abstract is written almost perfectly.

In doing so, it should provide an overview of the state of knowledge on the topic through a synthesis of previous research. A literature review should survey appropriate, relevant, and up-to-date sources. It also should persuade the reader of the scholarly significance and need for the proposed research project.</p></td><td><p>Reads as a dump of information, potentially taking the form of an “all about X” paper. Fails to connect the information to broader scholarly conversations or to use the information to justify the proposed project.</p></td><td><p>Provides some context for the scholarship included in the review and begins to identify a research problem or gap. Contains some synthesis of scholarship, but fails to provide a cohesive representation of the scholarly conversations surrounding the topic of the proposed project. May include some information that lacks relevance to the proposed project.</p></td><td><p>Synthesizes scholarship related to the proposed research project. A story is beginning to develop that demonstrates the relationships between relevant scholarly conversations and the proposed project.</p></td><td><p>Clarifies the research problem, gap, or issue to be addressed by the proposed research project. Strategically examines relations, themes, and trends in the literature in order to build a case for both the significance and need of the research project.</p></td><td><p>/15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Organisation</strong></p><p>A well-organized literature will guide the reader through the scholarly conversation surrounding a topic, setting up the specific contribution(s) the proposed research project will make to that conversation. The literature review should employ a broad-to-narrow structure, opening with context for the problem or issue the project will address, then explaining relevant relations, themes, and trends in existing literature, and ultimately highlighting the gap(s) or need(s) that the project will address. When appropriate (often at the end of the literature review), the literature review will present the proposed project’s research question or hypothesis. Paragraphs or sections should synthesize groups of related sources according to concept, theory, or methodology, rather than summarizing sources one at a time. A well-organized literature review will exhibit coherence, demonstrated by effective transitions, a logical flow of information within and among paragraphs, and balance among its various components.</p></td><td><p>Exhibits little strategic or deliberate organization. Lacks overall structure, and ideas appears randomly ordered. Lacks transitions between and within paragraphs. May not use paragraphs, or the division of paragraphs may lack logic.</p></td><td><p>Has some sense of order, but is confusing or inconsistent. The order of information does not effectively set up proposed research project or embed it within a broader scholarly conversation. May rely on formulaic or inconsistent organizational patterns and may not balance ideas appropriately in the paper. May have redundancies or circle around ideas. May move from study to study or author to author.</p></td><td><p>Displays a deliberate attempt to organize ideas. Has some transitions that shepherd the reader through the literature on the topic, but there may be missing information, abrupt turns, and/or out-ofsequence ideas. Has synthesis that connects thematically related studies within paragraphs or sections, but some studies, authors, or articles may not be fully integrated.</p></td><td><p>Demonstrates a deliberate organization that follows a broad to narrow structure. Seamlessly and efficiently transitions between ideas.</p><p>Paragraphs and sections synthesize related bodies of literature as opposed to summarizing single authors or sources.</p></td><td><p>/20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Support and development</strong></p><p>Support refers to the way the writer uses prior scholarship to develop ideas throughout the literature review and within its paragraphs and/or sections. A well developed literature review will analyze and critically evaluate the literature, utilizing details and examples from sources to provide evidence for its claims and to elaborate key points. It should go beyond superficial evaluations to provide commentary characterized by depth and complexity.</p></td><td><p>Support and development are severely lacking or absent. Problems with attribution, citation, and plagiarism may be present. If claims about the literature are present, they are not accompanied by adequate evidence and examples. Observations about and evaluations of sources, if present, may be uncritical, illogical, or contradictory. Heavily relies on quotation, and little to no attempt to integrate sources into sentences.</p></td><td><p>Support and development are faulty or inconsistent.
