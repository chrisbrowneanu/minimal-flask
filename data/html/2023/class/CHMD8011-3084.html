<p>Over 43 million persons are currently living under conditions of forced displacement.&nbsp; These persons are among the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable, with high rates of communicable and non-communicable disease, reproductive mortality, nutritional deficits, and psychological illness. This course provides an overview of the health needs of refugees, critically analysing from social, cultural and political perspectives the reasons for, and potential solutions, to poor health among displaced and resettled populations. Key areas to be addressed include the resources and capabilities of refugees, models of health service provision in temporary settlements and after resettlement, patterns of illness, and the debates about post-traumatic stress disorder. The course will consider case studies of refugees resettled from Sudan, Burma, Iran and Afghanistan, and will incorporate seminars from community leaders and resettlement workers.&nbsp;</p>

We will explore the escalations in refugee numbers over the last fifty years, and the international frameworks that govern and support the response of signatories to the challenge of large populations of people rendered stateless. At the end of this session you should be able to: * Explain the definitions of refugee in the Convention, and identify the parts of the Convention that are regarded as non-negotiable * Describe UN's three durable solutions to refugee flows * Critically review arguments on the relevance or irrelevance of the Convention for contemporary flows of asylum seekers * Describe the push factors that have driven the escalation in refugee flows over the last fifty years</td>

                <td>SESSION 2: INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT Seminar:50.8 million people (more than half of the world’s refugees) are internally displaced because of war and conflict. In 2020, Syria, Colombia and the Democratic Republic of Congo have the largest populations of people internally displaced due to war and conflict. Climate change disasters also intersect with and compound with internal displacement due to conflict, with 2020 being the first year in many decades where more people were displaced by climate change disasters than war, reflecting the global impacts of climate change across all nation states. In this seminar we will consider historical accounts of internal displacement, ways in which people are displaced in the contemporary world, and implications for health and health care. By the end of this session you should be able to * Identify where the largest internally displaced populations in the world are * Describe and explain the health risks associated with being internally displaced * Critically trace changing patterns of torture and violence against civilians * Use the Internal Displacement Index to compare regions’ responses to internal displacement</td>

Since many of these host countries are poor, local integration is challenging, marked sometimes by disenfranchisement of the refugee, and disenchantment by host communities. In this session we’ll examine models of local integration, potential impacts on health and ways of safety-netting. By the end of this session you should be able to * Describe what is meant by local integration in a host country * Identify key elements that support, or undermine, local integration * Identify potential risks for health associated with local integration * Describe system approaches to mitigate the risks to health in local integration models</td>

This session looks at the structures, systems and everyday life in a refugee camp. We conclude with an introduction to Agamben and his concept of bare life. The reading material is Agamben’s commentary on Hannah Arendt’s We Refugees.

From what you know about the experiences of refugees and their health systems, what other areas of health care delivery might be of concern? At the end of this seminar you should be able to: * Identify the major health issues associated with prolonged stay in a refugee camp * Identify health issues that may differ between different contexts * Describe, and provide a rationale for, critical health infrastructure for health care delivery in refugee camps.</td>

We will explore the number of countries engaged in formal resettlement, and the variations between their approach to resettlement and the services that are provided. Specific attention will be paid to Australia’s humanitarian resettlement program. At the end of this seminar you should be able to: * Describe the resettlement program as practised in Australia * Identify the top six resettlement countries, and identify key differences, and similarities between their resettlement programs. * Critically evaluate determinants of successful re-settlement, and whether or not these reflect the program or the population group. * Describe the health checks undertaken before arriving in Australia</td>

Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.

If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>
Academic Quality Assurance Committee monitors the performance of students, including attrition, further study and employment rates and grade distribution, and College reports on quality assurance processes for assessment activities, including alignment with national and international disciplinary and interdisciplinary standards, as well as qualification type learning outcomes.

Since first semester 1994, ANU uses a <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/grading-scale" target="_blank">grading scale</a> for all courses. This grading scale is used by all academic areas of the University.                                                <h2 id="support-for-students">Support for students</h2>
