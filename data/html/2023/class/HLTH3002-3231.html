<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>

<p>Academic integrity is a core part of the ANU culture as a community of scholars. The University’s students are an integral part of that community. The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2021L00997#_Toc35619227" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academic integrity principle</a> commits all students to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support, academic integrity, and to uphold this commitment by behaving honestly, responsibly and ethically, and with respect and fairness, in scholarly practice.</p><p><br></p><p>The University expects all staff and students to be familiar with the academic integrity principle, the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/about/governance/legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Integrity Rule 2021,</a> the <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Policy: Student Academic Integrity</a> and <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477150" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Procedure: Student Academic Integrity</a>, and to uphold high standards of academic integrity to ensure the quality and value of our qualifications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Academic Integrity Rule 2021 is a legal document that the University uses to promote academic integrity, and manage breaches of the academic integrity principle.
