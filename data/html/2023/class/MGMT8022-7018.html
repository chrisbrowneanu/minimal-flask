This is expected to be 250 words, and in reality, is to create an opportunity for you to get feedback on your intended plans for this assessment. This is due in week 4.</p><p><br></p><p>One approach to coming up with a strategy recommendation is to follow the “diagnosis - guiding principle - coordinated actions” framework that Rumelt suggests in his book “Good Strategy / Bad Strategy”.

A link to the article is available on wattle. What would be critical is how you use the information available in the case to converge on your diagnosis. The suitability of your “guiding principle” to your diagnosis, the executability of your recommended coordinated actions, as well as its coherence with the guiding principle are also important. Your analysis should also be based in some ways on what you think are the sources of competitive advantage for this organization. You might use the readings prescribed for week 4 (available on wattle) as a means of identifying where competitive advantage comes from for this particular organization. I will leave it up to you to find ways of incorporating all the above elements into one coherent and cogent strategy recommendation for this particular organization. The end product needs to be a polished strategy document that the management team of organisation would be happy to accept and implement.

<p><b>Strategy presentation</b></p>
<p>The third deliverable (Task 3), is a 10-15min presentation of your strategy recommendation. This will happen in weeks 10 and/or 11 (depending on the number of students in the course). Each group member is expected to present a portion of the group's presentation.</p><p>While the client memo and strategy report are treated as group assessments, the presentation will be marked as an individual assessment item. Presentations will be recorded via Echo360, which will enable later validation and verification of assessment if required (in accordance with ANU Student</p><p>Assessment (Coursework) policy).</p><p>One approach to coming up with a strategy recommendation is to follow the “diagnosis - guiding principle - coordinated actions” framework that Rumelt suggests in his book “Good Strategy / Bad Strategy”. The essence of this framework is also available in the McKinsey Insight article titled “The perils of bad strategy” that is prescribed reading for week 1. A link to the article is available on wattle. What would be critical is how you use the information available in the case to converge on your diagnosis. The suitability of your “guiding principle” to your diagnosis, the executability of your recommended coordinated actions, as well as its coherence with the guiding principle are also important. Your analysis should also be based in some ways on what you think are the sources of competitive advantage for this organization. You might use the readings prescribed for week 4 (available on wattle) as a means of identifying where competitive advantage comes from for this particular organization. I will leave it up to you to find ways of incorporating all the above elements into one coherent and cogent strategy recommendation for this particular organization. The end product needs to be a polished strategy document that the management team of organisation would be happy to accept and implement. Marking criteria for this assessment will be available on wattle at least two weeks before due date. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Due: Weeks 10 and/or 11 in-class</strong></p><p><strong>Feedback: by the end of week 12</strong></p>

<p><b>Reflective essay (Individual assessment)</b></p>
<p>There are three sets of journal articles that are assigned readings for weeks 2, 3, and 4. Links to these are available on Wattle and on this outline. Each set contains</p><p>articles representing different viewpoints in a debate relevant to the strategy field of knowledge. And across the articles in each set, there is a storyline that, in some</p><p>cases, depicts the evolution of the debate over time. In the reflective essay assessment, you will record your reflections on one of the three sets of readings.</p><p><br></p><p>So, as a<strong> first step</strong>, you will choose one of the three sets of readings. For example, if you were interested in the ‘economics’ versus ‘behavioural’ perspectives in strategy,</p><p>you would choose the set of readings that were assigned for week 2. If, on the other hand, you were interested in reflecting on various perspectives on the ‘sources of</p><p>competitive advantage’, you would choose the readings for week 4.</p><p><br></p><p>As the <strong>second</strong> step, you would read these papers carefully. I am aware that some of the articles are dense, and may not be easily comprehended. That is ok. Our interest is in the overall ideas of the papers, rather than their intricate technical details. You should then also search for and gather more journal papers that are relevant to the topic / debate for that week. Naturally, I cannot assign ALL the relevant papers in a debate as reading material. I have picked and chosen a few key ones. Your reflective piece would be all the better if you reach out to more papers beyond the ones that I have recommended.</p><p><br></p><p>As the <strong>third</strong> step, I would like you to sit back and reflect on what you have read. Think about being in an intellectual cafe, conversing with the group of authors of the papers you have read. What would you say to them about their collective work. Do you think their collective work is interesting and important? Is it compelling? Is it exciting? Do you think that, as a group, they have been on the right track to finding answers to the issues they have been debating? Do you think there could be ways to integrate their work together? Is there a storyline that connects their work together? If they invite you to come back again to join them for coffee so they can listen to your deep insights, what would your comments to them look like? These are some of the questions that you might keep in mind while reflecting on the papers.</p><p><br></p><p>What you need to submit (i.e., your “deliverable”) is your <strong>500 word written version of this reflection</strong>. The word count is exclusive of references, tables, etc.</p><p>A penalty will apply if you exceed the task word count by more than 10%.</p><p><br></p><p>In the written reflection, you need to include the following:</p><p class="ql-indent-1">(a) A<strong> title</strong> that that you have come up with that clearly implies which of the three sets of readings you are basing your reflection on</p><p class="ql-indent-1">(b) A very brief <strong>overview</strong> of the papers you have chosen to reflect on (at the minimum, these should consist of the assigned papers). In the overview, your focus should be on highlighting the storyline that connects the papers. What we don’t want is a “he said this”, “she said that” account.</p><p class="ql-indent-1">(c ) The larger part of the reflective report should be your own reflections on what you have read. You need to try and bring precision and coherency into your reflection, and also, you need to try and demonstrate deeper levels of thinking and insight. You need to say what you might do as a scholar to either extend the body of work you have just read. For example, you might suggest ways of evaluating competing arguments or standpoints in the debate. Or, alternatively, you might suggest ways to integrate the competing viewpoints in the literature into one coherent, mutually compatible view. Whatever you do, you should try hard to make unique and insightful observations. Afterall, this is a reflective piece and not a standard essay assignment. Feel free to use figures, tables, or charts if they better convey your ideas. But do also describe your figures and charts in the text.</p><p class="ql-indent-1">(d) Finally, you need to include full<strong> references</strong> to all the papers you have read and reflected on in this piece. Harvard style referencing is what we usually require.</p><p class="ql-indent-1">Marking criteria for this assessment will be available on wattle at least two weeks before submission date. Please do not hesitate to ask if you have any further</p><p class="ql-indent-1">questions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Due: 3pm, Wednesday in Week 11 through Turnitin on the course Wattle site</strong></p><p><strong>Feedback: with release of final grades Semester 2</strong></p>

The ANU has made a number of third party, online, databases available for students to use. Use of each online database is conditional on student end users first agreeing to the database licensor’s terms of service and/or privacy policy. Students should read these carefully. In some cases student end users will be required to register an account with the database licensor and submit personal information, including their: first name; last name; ANU email address; and other information.

In cases where student end users are asked to submit ‘content’ to a database, such as an assignment or short answers, the database licensor may only use the student’s ‘content’ in accordance with the terms of service — including any (copyright) licence the student grants to the database licensor. Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.

If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>

                            Alex Eapen is an Associate Professor of Strategy. His research interests include strategic management and international business. Alex has explored knowledge transfers in strategic alliances between firms and their impact on the choice between contractual and equity forms of alliance governance. He has also researched knowledge spillovers from foreign multinational enterprises to local firms in the host country, exploring both the conditions conducive to these positive spillovers and the empirical estimation techniques needed to accurately estimate their size. Alex is currently working with his former PhD students to understand how intermediaries and Government financial assistance helps catalyse the innovation efforts of Australian businesses, the impact of environmental strategies on firms’ R&amp;D productivity, and how multipoint competition influences businesses’ rate of new product launches.&nbsp;Some of Alex’s work has received financial support from funders including the Australian Department of Defence and the Commonwealth Department of Employment, while his publications have appeared in leading journals such as&nbsp;<em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Organization Science, Journal of International Business Studies, Economic Modelling</em>, and&nbsp;<em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences</em>.
