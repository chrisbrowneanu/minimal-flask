<p>The course, which is presently&nbsp;delivered by the Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies on behalf of the ANU College of Business and Economics, &nbsp;provides an overview of business in the Middle East and an examination of specific issues for companies doing business in the region. The course focuses most on the Arab countries of the Middle East, but with some attention paid to Turkey, Israel and Iran as well. Specific topics include the Middle Eastern business environment, the cultural specifics of the region that impact on business, the legal framework, and specific strategies in international and cross-cultural marketing, human resource management, labour relations, logistics, and finance.&nbsp; Strategies for dealing with the public sector in the region also are covered, given the role of bureaucracies and state -owned enterprises in the region.&nbsp; The aim of the course is to enhance students' understanding of the Middle Eastern business environment and the ways in which various dynamics impact on business operations of firms in the region.</p>

Academic integrity is a core part of our culture as a community of scholars. At its heart, academic integrity is about behaving ethically.

We ensure that all members of our community understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity. The ANU expects staff and students to uphold high standards of academic integrity and act ethically and honestly, to ensure the quality and value of the qualification that you will graduate with. The University has policies and procedures in place to promote academic integrity and manage academic misconduct.
