<p><strong>Research-led and practice-based teaching: </strong>The course offers students a rare opportunity to use their growing theoretical and methodological skills in research practice. This course will teach students the latest tools and methods used in social sciences and more particularly in the discipline of marketing.</p><p><strong>Research-based assessment </strong></p><p><strong><em>P</em></strong><strong style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><em>ractical (industry-related)</em></strong>: Students work in groups (4-5 individuals) on a marketing project for an industry client. Students can select their own group and clients are allocated to each group on a first-come, first-served basis. The research project will consist of a report that relates to a real marketing problem (i.e., an empirical problem) that an industry, company, or small enterprise faces. Groups will endeavor to carry out their investigation using the <strong><u>theoretical knowledge and research techniques</u></strong> taught in this course to collect data and the best available evidence to come up with solutions that clients will use. The <u>industry-related project </u>is distinctive action research that is the <strong>Work Integrated Learning</strong> component of this course. Action learning features of the course drive a ‘student-centered’ and ‘learning by doing’ approach. The course facilitates student engagement with research via:</p><ul><li>A comprehensive introduction to the purpose of research through a problem-based approach.</li><li>A research process to explain various methods that will be proposed through a marketing research proposal.</li><li>Independent and team-based action learning and research using core marketing research concepts, theories, principles, research, and data analysis skills to write up the research report.</li></ul>                                                    <h2 id="field-trips">Field Trips</h2>

<p><b>Marketing Research Project: Group Report (Industry related) (25%)</b></p>
<p><strong>Assessment Description: </strong>A semester-long research project report based on a client's marketing problem is an essential part of this course. This report allows students to showcase the research project. It needs to provide the client with solutions to the marketing problem they want the group to solve. The project showcases students' competence in conducting the research. Students will apply to some extent learned concepts to marketing-related problems that an industry client or company or small enterprise would have presented in a brief at the beginning of the semester (by weeks 2/3). The marketing research industry is structured so that businesses commission research to be conducted by marketing research firms. Groups of 4-5 students will take the role of marketing researchers who have been commissioned to conduct a research project on behalf of a business client. Once the problem is ascertained, theoretical concepts identified and reviewed, students will then apply their learning of research processes, methods, and analysis techniques to complete the following:</p><ul><li>Translate the client's marketing problem into a research problem (with appropriate research questions)</li><li>Define the purpose and objectives of the research</li><li>Critically review and discuss the theoretical concepts that are relevant to the problem studied</li><li>Design the marketing research project</li><li>Identify and apply appropriate methods (both qualitative and quantitative) of data collection</li><li>Identify and discuss the appropriate methods of analysis</li><li>Analyse data</li><li>Reporting the results</li><li>Identify possible challenges during the research process and limitations of the research</li><li>Propose recommendations on how to possibly overcome the challenges</li></ul><p><strong>Assessment Type: </strong>Group</p><p><strong>Words:</strong> 2500 words (+/- 10%) (including all headings, sub-headings, and in-text citations).

Extensions and late submission of assessment pieces are covered by the Student Assessment (Coursework) <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_004603" target="_blank">Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_004604" target="_blank">Procedure</a> The Course Convener may grant extensions for assessment pieces that are not examinations or take-home examinations. If you need an extension, you must request an extension in writing on or before the due date. If you have documented and appropriate medical evidence that demonstrates you were not able to request an extension on or before the due date, you may be able to request it after the due date.                                                <h2 id="resubmission-of-assignments">Resubmission of Assignments</h2>
<p>Unless specified otherwise in the assignment requirements, resubmissions are permitted up until the due date and time, but not allowed afterward.</p>                                                                            <h2 id="privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</h2>
The ANU has made a number of third party, online, databases available for students to use. Use of each online database is conditional on student end users first agreeing to the database licensor’s terms of service and/or privacy policy. Students should read these carefully. In some cases student end users will be required to register an account with the database licensor and submit personal information, including their: first name; last name; ANU email address; and other information.

In cases where student end users are asked to submit ‘content’ to a database, such as an assignment or short answers, the database licensor may only use the student’s ‘content’ in accordance with the terms of service — including any (copyright) licence the student grants to the database licensor. Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.

If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>
Academic Quality Assurance Committee monitors the performance of students, including attrition, further study and employment rates and grade distribution, and College reports on quality assurance processes for assessment activities, including alignment with national and international disciplinary and interdisciplinary standards, as well as qualification type learning outcomes.

Since first semester 1994, ANU uses a <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/grading-scale" target="_blank">grading scale</a> for all courses. This grading scale is used by all academic areas of the University.                                                <h2 id="support-for-students">Support for students</h2>
