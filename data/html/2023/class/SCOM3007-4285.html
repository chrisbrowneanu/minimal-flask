<p>This course is about creating your own original science communication passion project! Using design thinking and inspiration from diverse guest presenters, you’ll come up with a novel program idea, pilot it, and report on your pilot. Lectures and interactive workshops will share approaches to help you get creative, find your purpose, create effective partnerships, and manage and evaluate your project. It represents an authentic opportunity to develop real-world skills that allow your ideas to become realities. </p><p><br></p><p>Science communication, engagement and outreach programs employ a range of methods to connect with audiences, create impact and communicate science. From capacity building programs in low- and middle-income countries to science puppet shows for early learners, science communicators employ different methods, often to better engage with underserviced audiences, create impact and social change, and explore topics in more intriguing ways. As part of this, they need to be skilled at conceiving ideas, logistics and program planning, ‘selling’ their ideas and securing funding, running events and evaluating their success. As you’ll discover in your future science communication or other careers, if you want to pursue your passions, your goals and your ideas, skills to develop them and just as importantly get them funded are critical. Many past students’ ideas have turned into funded, real-world, ongoing projects that have had national and global impacts, so don’t underestimate what you might achieve if you make the most of it! If you choose, this can be so much more than just another assignment.</p>

                            <p>
                                Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
                            </p>
<ol><li>Critically appraise different formats for communicating science;</li><li>Examine the process of conceiving, developing, delivering and evaluating science communication programs;</li><li>Apply this process to create novel science communication programs;</li><li>Analyse and reflect on science communication programs, including conveying this via written formats.</li></ol>
                            <h2 id="research-led-teaching">Research-Led Teaching</h2>
<p>Students will be introduced to a range of research literature concerning the engagement methods they decide to employ and actively critique and reflect on it. During the intensive you will be able to interact with experts in various engagement methods who, in some cases, will use their own or other research to show the efficacy of approaches. In the course of evaluating your event, you will be familiarised with basic research methods and innovative approaches data collection, including examples of their use in the research literature, and apply these to analyse your own event/program - this process gives a basic introduction to the research process when investigating science engagement programs and events.</p>                                                    <h2 id="field-trips">Field Trips</h2>

<p>Students need to cover costs (if any) for their Pilot event/program, however resources from CPAS will be made available, and strategies for microfunding and partnerships/donations to minimise/eliminate costs will be discussed. Please talk to Graham if you need financial support and he'll do his best to help.</p>                                                                                                    <h2 id="recommended-resources">Recommended Resources</h2>
<p><em>As every student's project is unique and creative, the detail of particular methods you choose, relevant literature, and other background may not be covered in detail during the intensive. Hence, you are encouraged to make a time to meet with Graham to discuss your project or email him at any time. This is especially encouraged as you formulate your Project Proposal and plan for your pilot. </em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>COVID_19:</strong> covid may affect the scope of your event/project, however science communicators around the world have responded to the crisis in innovative ways and while challenging it can also be great for creativity. Please note your project - especially interactions with the public - must comply with guidelines issued by the ANU and Government of the state/territory you are operating in. <strong>Wide flexibility will be given to adapt to covid implications - please contact Graham with any issues you are facing.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For anyone creating science engagement programs/events, <a href="https://www.informalscience.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.informalscience.org/</a> is a very helpful, easily searched and pre-digested way to access research papers and evaluation reports on a wide range of events and programs, however please click through the summaries and access the original source material/papers.

<p>In this course, you’ll come up with a novel program idea, trial it, report on your trial and then learn how to win funding for it through grant applications and a presented ‘pitch’.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Groups</u>: In <a href="/2023/course/SCOM3007">SCOM3007</a>, you may work in groups with other <u>undergraduate</u> students up to a maximum of <u>four</u> people, or you may choose to work alone. Note assessment requirements change for groups, and even if you are in a group some assessment items are still prepared individually - please see the assessment items for details. Groups are expected to create a program/event of a larger scale. If you haven't had experience managing a project/event before, definitely consider group work.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There are undergraduate (<a href="/2023/course/SCOM3007">SCOM3007</a>) and postgraduate (<a href="/2023/course/SCOM6007">SCOM6007</a>) versions of this course - note they have different assessment requirements and due dates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This course uses a project-based learning (learning by doing) approach to take you through this process. You’ll:</p><ul><li>Be introduced to a range of science engagement and outreach methods</li><li>Connect with experts in these methods</li><li>Conceive your own event/program, and plan it</li><li>Trial it through an event/program with the intended audience, and manage the project</li><li>Evaluate its impact and how it can be improved</li><li>Go through a grant funding application process</li></ul><p><br></p><p>While the overall process may appear daunting, the project-based learning approach will give you the skills and knowledge you need at the appropriate time as we go along.</p><p><br></p><p>Note there is some flexibility as to when you submit your Program Plan, and when you run your Trial, to accommodate students with fieldwork and requirements in other courses, or generally eager beavers. See the relevant sections below.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is about creating your own original science communication program. It represents an authentic opportunity to develop real-world skills that allow your ideas to become realities. As you’ll discover in your future careers, if you want to pursue your passions, your goals and your IDEAS, skills to develop them and just as importantly get them funded are critical.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Many past students’ ideas have turned into actual, fully funded, real-world ongoing projects that have had national and global impacts, so don’t underestimate what you might achieve if you make the most of it! If you choose, this can be so much more than just another assignment.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Science engagement and outreach methods covered include (however students are not limited to):</p><ul><li>Making, tinkering and makerspaces</li><li>Science centre exhibits and interactive exhibitions – from polished to DIY</li><li>Working with researchers and communicating research</li><li>Participatory methods to engage with environmental/societal aspects of science and technology</li><li>Art-science events/displays/performances</li><li>Facilitated discussions/workshops – panel type events, from casual to serious</li><li>Science shows and workshops (not dealt with in detail in this course).</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Exact content may vary with availability of guest lecturers/experts in these fields.</p><p><br></p><p>Students choose which of these methods to use in their own project, can create fusions or propose their own novel approaches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Students are strongly encouraged to make use of the </u><strong><u>ANU Makerspace</u></strong><u> if</u><em><u> </u></em><u>it is appropriate for their program. i.e. maker workshops, prop or costume building, coding and electronics, etc.</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please note throughout the process <strong>you should represent yourself as an ANU student</strong>, especially when trialing the concept with the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>As this unit requires a lot of creative, individual output, lectures are kept to a minimum, however you can make a time to meet with Graham to discuss your project or email him at any time. This is especially encouraged as you formulate your Project Proposal and plan for your trial. </em></p>                                                    <h2 id="class-schedule">Class Schedule</h2>

<p><b>Project Plan </b></p>
<p>This assignment requires you to propose your project idea, method(s) and describe how you will pilot it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Groups</u> should submit one homogeneous, integrated plan - see the Marking Criteria.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE RE TIMING OF PILOTS AND SUBMISSION OF PLANS: National Science Week occurs all over Australia usually in the second week of August (check online for exact dates year to year), with some events either side of the official week. If you would like to try and integrate your pilot event with the week, or just want to run your project earlier, you are welcome to submit your Project Plan earlier. <u>You must have written a plan and got feedback, especially regarding any risks, before implementing your event</u>, however marks will be issued once all Plans are submitted. Contact Graham in advance if you are planning to do this.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Project Plan is the MOST critical thing to get right as all your future work will lead from it. Taking the time to fully develop a creative, unique, well planned and high-quality idea will give you a much better chance to do well on subsequent assessment pieces and your pilot – as well as make everything easier. Underinvestment or rushing at this stage may well have negative effects down the track.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your plan should address the following areas:</p><p>The project/event:</p><ul><li>Name of your program</li><li>Aims - clear and specific</li><li>Description/design, including activities/components and how they will achieve your aims (a diagram can work wonders here!)</li><li>Target audience/public, including how you have considered them in the design</li><li>Partners/collaborators/donors (where relevant) – provisional or locked-in</li><li>The science communication method(s) you will use, including relevant research/literature and how it has informed your design</li><li>Design rationale – does it address a pressing need or solve a problem, why did you choose it, what gap/niche does it fill?</li><li>A short statement on your creative process and why your idea is novel.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pilot details (noting it is a work in progress at this stage, BUT KEY DETAILS SHOULD BE LOCKED IN):</p><ul><li>Implementation plan, including potential or (hopefully) confirmed venues, promotional strategy (if relevant), running sheet/timetable, etc. These details will evolve, but you should have the key details locked in.</li><li>A flow chart, gant chart, hierarchical list, or similar identifying the key tasks, the order they need to occur, critical interdependencies between tasks (e.g. venue needs to be confirmed before promo flyer can be made) and the key stakeholders/partners.</li><li>ESSENTIAL - any major risks and how you will avoid/minimise/manage the risks.</li><li>Key aspects to evaluate and how this will allow you to assess program outcomes or make program improvements.</li><li>Budget. The budget for your pilot, if any, should be as small as possible. Most materials should be initially sourced for free from CPAS storerooms, ANU Makerspace or similar. If materials/funds still have be sourced, students are encouraged to source in-kind support (donations/partnerships) or external small funding (e.g. ANU PARSA small grants) wherever possible – this will be duly rewarded when the Pilot Report is assessed, and Graham is happy to help here.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Note your pilot may or may not include all aspects of your proposed project (e.g. you may have constraints due to budget), however it must be representative of the key features, and must be run with as close to an authentic (public) audience as possible - please refer to the Piloting the Project section below.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Many aspects of the pilot details above aim to ensure smooth delivery.

<p><b>Piloting the Project</b></p>
<p>The pilot is an opportunity for you to bring your program idea into reality, see how the audience engage with it, and evaluate. The evaluation should give you data to see if you are achieving your aims, as well as how you could improve the program. Note, due to some students running pilots interstate, simultaneously and/or out of hours, the pilot is assessed through the subsequent report - especially the description, photos, evaluation component and evaluation data - rather than by a course convenor actually attending, however the convenor may also attend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Groups</u>: it is expected that the <u>scale and outcomes of your pilot are proportional to the size of your group</u>. This may be achieved through greater time/effort in preparation (e.g. building exhibits, making equipment), a bigger event, or a phased or multifaceted event. Note a Peer Assessment to assess relative input of group members is included in the Pilot Report.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When. </strong>The pilot should occur during August-September (note the report is due end September). <strong><u>You must submit your Project Plan before running the pilot</u></strong>. The latest you can submit the Project Plan is late August (see due dates), but you are welcome to submit it earlier if you would like to run your pilot earlier - <strong><u>contact Graham if you are submitting early so he can give you feedback promptly</u></strong>, however marks will be issued once all Plans are submitted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A representative pilot.</strong> You pilot event/project may or may not be the exact project you’ve proposed, but does need to be representative of the key features of your project and include the target audience, e.g.:</p><ul><li>Your project is to run a student science show competition where you train multiple schools to do a show then they do a huge gala, but for the pilot you just train two schools and have a friendly combined performance.</li><li>You plan an art-science display with 10 different artists, but you only pilot three that are central/representative to the overall display.</li><li>You plan on making a set of 10 exhibits/workshop activities on a topic, but only pilot two main ones.</li><li>You use a smaller/alternate but representative audience/venue/etc.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The specifics of this really depend on your project, so please talk to Graham first if you’re not sure if your pilot is representative.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Phased pilots. </strong>For some projects, it may be practical and wise to run the pilot in two phases, i.e. do&nbsp;a small scale ‘prototype’ pilot to get initial feedback (e.g. test some hands-on activities with peers or friends), which then informs the second ‘main event’ pilot (e.g. running the activities with a group of primary school students).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Representative audience.</strong> Pilots of your project should, ideally, be completed with a representative audience – as close to your ideal target audience as possible. While classmates may attend, don’t relying on them for a major segment of the audience – if this is a risk then make sure you have a promo plan in place. If you are struggling to find a representative audience, please let us know as we have contacts, and consider partnerships to access guaranteed audiences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TIP: </strong><u>Get in contact early</u> with schools, Scout groups, Rotary, Questacon (QLab is great place to pilot exhibits) or other organisations that you want to pilot your project with. These are excellent partners because they guarantee you a good audience without the need for promotions, removing a huge risk from your program.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Evaluation. </strong>Your evaluation should do two things: (1) assess the audience’s experience of your program/event and whether you met you aims, and (2) give you information to further develop your program. The evaluation doesn’t need to be lengthy (e.g. could be half A4 page survey), but it does need to give you data to assess these aspects. You need to decide what method(s) of data collection (e.g. a short interview, survey, informal methods, observation, a combination, etc.) best suits your needs and program. When designing your evaluation, think how you’ll analyse the results. Some common evaluation methods will be covered in class.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The minimum requirements for the 3007 pilot are:</p><ul><li>The pilot must meaningfully represent the key elements of your project (but not necessarily all elements).</li><li>You must do your utmost to run a pilot with a representative (public) audience, i.e. an audience that is similar to or the same as your intended/target audience. If you run a phased trial, the ‘main event’ should be with a representative audience, but the audience for your ‘prototype trial’ is at your discretion.</li><li>You must evaluate the pilot.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like in the real world, exceeding the minimum requirements will be noted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note: while conducting the pilot you should represent yourself as a student of The Australian National University</strong>. See the introduction for more details. Graham can also arrange ANU public liability insurance certificates if venues require them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sessions will cover aspects such as project management and other organisational tools to deliver smooth well organised programs, however if you have not run events/programs before you are advised to also talk through your plan with Graham. You may also want to refer to advice on the <a href="http://www.scienceweek.net.au/get-involved/organise-an-event" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Science Week website about running events.</a></p><p><br></p><p>Please note the due date of this assessment task is variable. The dates in the assessment summary are an indication only of the period in which the pilot should be conducted. Please check with the the course convener if you have any concerns.</p><p><br></p><p>The Pilot is assessed via the Pilot Report as below, please see Marking Criteria below.</p>

<p><b>Pilot Report </b></p>
<p>In this assignment, you need to report on exactly what you piloted and how it went, including description, results and analysis of your evaluation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Groups</u>: Each group member should submit their own report,</strong> drawing on common evaluation and other data. You may do basic data processing, photo collation, general discussion, etc. in your group, but it is expected that you will <strong>work independently </strong>on the self-reflection, interpretation of data, background research and other aspects of your report. <strong>The analysis and thinking should be your own.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description. </strong>Include a description and photos of your pilot with all the main details (e.g. what, where, audience, etc.). It should have <strong><u>enough details that someone who didn’t attend the event has a very clear idea of what happened</u></strong> and would be able to clearly imagine the whole event, setting, who came, what happened and what the audience did, audience engagement/disengagement, any major highlights or key features, and any other relevant details. Pictures tell a thousand words, but don't count towards the word count - so make the most of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-reflection. </strong>Provide a self-reflection of how things went from your point of view. This may include, but should not be limited by, aspects such as:</p><ul><li>Did you program work as you intended?</li><li>Were there any surprises, either good or bad?</li><li>What were the strengths and weaknesses?</li><li>How were the relationships and interactions with partners?</li><li>What was the audiences’ response?</li><li>What did you learn?</li><li>What might you do differently next time, and which elements worked well as they are?</li><li><u>How does your experience/outcomes compare to findings in the literature?</u></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should integrate and interpret content from the self-reflection, rather than just provide a list like the above dot points. The reflection should compare your insights with research on comparable programs from the literature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation results and analysis. </strong>The report should include the results of your evaluation (see previous page) including key demographic details of your sample and a summary of your results. You should also analyse and interpret the results and draw conclusions from them, i.e. what does the data mean in the context of your program? The analysis should also <u>compare your findings with research on comparable programs from the literature.</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Evaluation instruments, such as a sample survey or list of interview questions (if relevant), should be provided as an appendix and do not count towards the word limit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions and recommendations. </strong>This final section should <strong>bring together </strong>all three previous sections, particularly the self-reflection and evaluation, to determine what you achieved and how to improve your program. What new insights are evident when the self-reflection and evaluation are taken together? Combine your own insights and analysis of the evaluation data to provide well-reasoned evidence-based recommendations to improve your program.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Marking Criteria</strong></p><p>To be eligible for a pass on this assignment your report must:</p><ul><li>Be 1000-1500 words long, excluding your final reference list and survey instrument (if applicable).</li><li>Include a description with photos, self-reflection, evaluation, and conclusions and recommendations.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, your report should ideally:</p><ul><li>Give a detailed, clear, vivid, easily interpreted description of the pilot event/program, including photos and key metrics (dates, times, attendance, etc.), which is <strong><u>almost as good as being there in person</u></strong>. Note assessment of the project/event itself is a large part of how marks are allocated.</li><li><strong><u>Include photos</u></strong> of key aspects of the program – such as people completing activities, design features of exhibits, etc. – meaningfully captioned and annotated where suitable.</li><li>Include a deep, honest and insightful self-reflection, which critiques (good and bad) key aspects and includes insights that only you as the program designer could fully identify.</li><li>Report your evaluation data in a clear, detailed and precise manner consistent with academic conventions and standards, using elements (e.g. tables, diagrams, graphs) that summarise and organise the data so accurate, in-depth interpretation is straightforward.</li><li>Analyse the evaluation data using techniques appropriate for the chosen method (e.g. basic statistical analysis of survey data) and interpret and extrapolate what the findings mean.</li><li>Synthesise the description of the event, your self-reflection and the evaluation findings (bring it all together) to give a holistic evidence-based analysis of the event that leads logically and clearly to an assessment of your impact and practical recommendations to improve your event logistics, outcomes and audience experience.</li><li>Show evidence of background research, use of the academic literature, consultation with peers/experts, and appropriate referencing.</li><li>Be neatly formatted, written in clear and concise language, have excellent spelling, punctuation, grammar and sentence/paragraph structure.</li><li>Include diagrams, tables and/or figures that enhance communication, in particular illustrative images in the description and tables and diagrams in the evaluation section.</li></ul>

<p><b>Pilot / Pilot Report - Peer Assessment (Groups only)</b></p>
<p>For group members, your Pilot Report will be given a mark, which may be modified based on the peer assessment. <strong>Individuals do not need to submit a Peer Assessment.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Please submit a table/list giving each group member - including yourself - a score reflecting the effort put into <strong><u>planning, preparing for and implementing the pilot</u></strong>. Use full names and also include the name of your project. For scoring, give 100 for an appropriate amount of effort, above 100 for an extraordinary effort, and below 100 for inadequate effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Please make sure the total adds up to n x 100, e.g. if there are 3 people in your group it should add to 300 (for example, 90, 100, 110). Note equal effort does not necessarily mean doing the same kind of work, it is up to you to divide the necessary tasks evenly. Then you will be able to estimate how much effort each person put into the tasks allocated to them.</p><p><br></p><p>You must justify any mark less than 100 - include a brief comment.</p><p><br></p><p>An individual mark will be calculated for each group member by multiplying your Report mark by the average of you Peer Assessment mark. e.g. if you and all other group members give you 100, your mark will be unchanged, if they give you 80 it will be scaled down by 20%, etc.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Marking Criteria</strong></p><p>To be eligible for a pass on this assignment your assessment must:</p><ul><li>Give scores to all group members</li><li>Include full names and your project name</li></ul>
