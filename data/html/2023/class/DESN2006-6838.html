<p>Front-End web design is concerned with the design and production of website elements that directly shape a user&rsquo;s experience of a site. Front-end web has a broad scope, encompassing elements such as typography, layout, visual aesthetics, interface behaviours, and information architecture. It is a highly dynamic, burgeoning field of practice that is the creative engine-room of the modern web. This course provides a hands-on foundation in front-end web, introducing students to its fundamental concepts, theories, production practices and core technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. The skills and knowledge acquired in this course are versatile and powerful, and will be of value to students from any field of study.</p>

<p><b>Research Report &amp; Design Development</b></p>
<p><strong>Website overview</strong></p><p>In this course you will research, plan, and produce a working website that is tailored to the content of a particular client to promote and inform stakeholders and audience about their work. A full creative brief will be supplied via the course Wattle site.</p><p>This first assessment focuses on the planning and design of your website. It requires you to research, analyse and adapt existing website conventions, and apply them in your own designs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Research Report</strong></p><p>The aim of the research and analysis is to develop understanding of web design practices before embarking on the design and production of your own site. The focus of the analysis is design conventions. Conventions underpin the organisation, presentation, function and behaviour of all websites. They serve as useful design rules but are cultural inventions, changing over time and adapting to different contexts. Therefore, it is integral that you identify websites and conventions that are most relevant to your particular aims and objectives for your project's client and their key stakeholders.</p><p>Identify at least 4 existing websites with relevance to the project brief and your design aims&nbsp;&nbsp;(ie. Not Facebook, or Google, or Amazon, or Pinterest, or Instagram, etc.). Audit these websites and identify and document design elements, conventions and patterns. Where required, seek out additional websites to further investigate particular conventions or patterns.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Design Development</strong></p><p>Develop a set of your own webpage designs and assets that apply the design conventions and patterns identified in your research. Detail the look and feel of your website including layout, navigation, typography, colour, backgrounds and other visual details. See the brief on Wattle for a complete list of details for material to be submitted. You will prepare for mobile and desktop resolutions the following media:</p><p><br></p><p>Wireflows detailing the two different user journeys mobile and desktop sizes using supplied content. See the brief on Wattle for examples.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Research Report Proposed Design Rationale</strong></p><p>Your report should finish with a concluding section that details your proposed design rationale. You should use screenshots of your selected websites at mobile and desktop widths to highlight the key elements, conventions and patterns you will be informed by. You should evidence this by using screenshots of your designs at mobile and desktop widths with all of the key elements, conventions and patterns you have implemented labelled. This is a written explanation of your design decisions. Substantiate your design choices with evidence from your research, relevant resources and analysis of the project brief.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Submissions must include:</strong></p><ol><li>Wireflows for your design at mobile and desktop widths</li><li>Wireframes for your design at mobile and desktop widths</li><li>Report - 2000 word maximum. Cite all references using Chicago citation style.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>Submission:</strong> Assemble all of the required documentation together into a single PDF and submit on Wattle with your assets. Your submission must feature all of the required content as listed in the full brief posted on Wattle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Assessment Criteria:</strong></p><ol><li>Create wireframes and assets that follow specifications and illustrate detailed designs (LO, 1, 2)</li><li>Create wireflows that fully detail functionality and information architecture (LO 1, 2)</li><li>Research and apply relevant conventions and patterns to design and substantiate with evidence from the field (LO 3, 4)</li></ol>

<p><b>HTML Website Sprint</b></p>
<p>This project focuses on using&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTML</a>&nbsp;to create the foundation a working website in a design sprint context. Design sprints are events that facilitate the development of work in an short amount of time. The idea is to devote focused attention on achieving the goals associated with development towards a project. Often development includes adapting and incorporating new methodologies outside a designer's skill-set.</p><p><br></p><p>The HTML Website Sprint requires you to markup a client’s content into a semantic HTML website. Content will be released on Wattle at the beginning of the sprint. While much of your analysis for the Research &amp; Design project focused on the visual attributes of websites (colour, layout, sizing, etc.),&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">semantic HTML</a>&nbsp;is concerned with using HTML tags to describe the meaning of the content. The challenge in creating semantic HTML pages is to largely ignore what your pages look like (colours, fonts, sizing, layout etc.) and focus on applying HTML tags that accurately describe the content (ie. paragraph, heading, image, caption, nav, list, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Using the client’s content, create a structured HTML website. Research and apply HTML tags that describe the type of content being displayed. Ensure you include all of the content - don’t leave anything out. Include links to allow navigation, as well as links to external sites and resources. Use best practices for naming and organising your files for web.</p><p><br></p><p>Your functioning HTML website must feature the content featured in the brief.&nbsp;In addition, your HTML site must address the following requirements:</p><ul><li>Full content (full texts, all images and video, all image/video details etc.)</li><li>Semantic html that accurately and accessibly describes your content</li><li>Error free code with generous comments demonstrating deep understanding</li><li>HTML is&nbsp;<a href="https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accessible</a></li><li>Functional navigation, and links to sites/resources</li><li>Files named and organised following web best practices</li><li>HTML only - no CSS or styling of any kind.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Submission: Submit your website including all HTML, images and associated files following the procedures outlined on the submission page on Wattle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;<u>You cannot use any machine-generated or third party code.</u>&nbsp;You must personally author all of your code.
