<p>This course builds on the material introduced in introductory Business Information Systems courses by covering how business analytics and business intelligence can be used for improved business decision-making. Contemporary forms of analytics such as visual, text, sentiment, web, and social are covered in the course, as well as established technologies like decision support, knowledge management, collaborative and expert systems.</p>

ANU is committed to the demonstration of educational excellence and regularly seeks feedback from students. Students are encouraged to offer feedback directly to their Course Convener or through their College and Course representatives (if applicable). The feedback given in these surveys is anonymous and provides the Colleges, University Education Committee and Academic Board with opportunities to recognise excellent teaching, and opportunities for improvement. The <a href="http://unistats.anu.edu.au/surveys/selt/students/" target="_blank">Surveys and Evaluation website</a> provides more information on student surveys at ANU and <a href="http://unistats.anu.edu.au/surveys/selt/results/learning/" target="_blank">reports</a> on the feedback provided on ANU courses.                                                    <h2 id="other-information">Other Information</h2>
<p><strong>Scaling</strong></p><p>Your final mark for the course will be based on the&nbsp;raw&nbsp;marks allocated for each of your assessment items. However, your final mark may not be the same number as produced by that formula, as marks may be&nbsp;scaled. Any scaling applied will preserve the rank order of raw marks (i.e. if your raw mark exceeds that of another student, then your scaled mark&nbsp;will exceed the scaled mark of that student), and may be either up or down.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support for students</strong></p><p>The University offers a number of support services for students.

                    <h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
Academic integrity is a core part of our culture as a community of scholars. At its heart, academic integrity is about behaving ethically. This means that all members of the community commit to honest and responsible scholarly practice and to upholding these values with respect and fairness. The Australian National University commits to embedding the values of academic integrity in our teaching and learning. We ensure that all members of our community understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity. The ANU expects staff and students to uphold high standards of academic integrity and act ethically and honestly, to ensure the quality and value of the qualification that you will graduate with. The University has policies and procedures in place to promote academic integrity and manage academic misconduct. Visit the following <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/academic-honesty-plagiarism" target="_blank">Academic honesty & plagiarism website</a> for more information about academic integrity and what the ANU considers academic misconduct. The ANU offers a number of services to assist students with their assignments, examinations, and other learning activities. The <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/learning-development" target="_blank">Academic Skills and Learning Centre</a> offers a number of workshops and seminars that you may find useful for your studies.                                                <h2 id="onlinesubmission">Online Submission</h2>
<p>The ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity.

For some forms of assessment (hand written assignments, art works, laboratory notes, etc.) hard copy submission is appropriate when approved by the Associate Dean (Education). Hard copy submissions must utilise the Assignment Cover Sheet. Please keep a copy of tasks completed for your records.                                                <h2 id="latesubmission">Late Submission</h2>
<p><strong>No submission of fortnightly assessment or reflective journal tasks without an extension after the due date will be permitted. If a fortnightly assessment or reflective journal task is not submitted by the due date, a mark of 0 will be awarded.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Late submission of report assessment tasks without an extension are penalised at the rate of 5% of the possible marks available per working day or part thereof. Late submission of assessment tasks is not accepted after 10 working days after the due date, or on or after the date specified in the course outline for the return of the assessment item. Late submission is not accepted for take-home examinations.</p><p><br></p><p>All requests for extensions to assessment in RSM courses must be submitted to the RSM School Office with a completed application form and supporting documentation.

<p>Unless specified otherwise in the assignment requirements, resubmissions are permitted up until the due date and time, but not allowed afterwards.</p>                                                                            <h2 id="privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</h2>
The ANU has made a number of third party, online, databases available for students to use. Use of each online database is conditional on student end users first agreeing to the database licensor’s terms of service and/or privacy policy. Students should read these carefully. In some cases student end users will be required to register an account with the database licensor and submit personal information, including their: first name; last name; ANU email address; and other information.

In cases where student end users are asked to submit ‘content’ to a database, such as an assignment or short answers, the database licensor may only use the student’s ‘content’ in accordance with the terms of service — including any (copyright) licence the student grants to the database licensor. Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.

If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>
Academic Quality Assurance Committee monitors the performance of students, including attrition, further study and employment rates and grade distribution, and College reports on quality assurance processes for assessment activities, including alignment with national and international disciplinary and interdisciplinary standards, as well as qualification type learning outcomes.

Since first semester 1994, ANU uses a <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/grading-scale" target="_blank">grading scale</a> for all courses. This grading scale is used by all academic areas of the University.                                                <h2 id="support-for-students">Support for students</h2>
