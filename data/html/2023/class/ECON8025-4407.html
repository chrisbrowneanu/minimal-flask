<p>Microeconomics provides the principal modelling tools and frameworks that are used in all fields of economics. The corresponding techniques are built on models of decision-making by economic agents, in environments with and without uncertainty, and on the analysis of interacting economic agents, in various settings such as markets or strategic situations. This course introduces the main techniques of microeconomics, at a level that lies between that of typical undergraduate courses, and that of Masters or PhD level courses. The results are presented and analysed using both intuitive graphical and formal mathematical methods. An important aim of the course is to show that the intuition gained from simple graphical models, and the insight derived from formal theoretical analysis are complementary, and that only the interplay between economic intuition and abstract results can lead to a complete understanding of the respective models and the conclusions drawn from their analysis.</p>

<p>We have been informed by the Associate Dean for Education for the ANU College of Business and Economics that there will be no "in person" examinations held by ANU in Semester One of 2022. As such, the exam for this course will be administered online and invigilated over Zoom. You will need a computing device with a working web-camera that is capable of running both Zoom and the Wattle site for this course. The web-camera will only be required for the purpose of invigilating the final exam.</p>                                                    <h2 id="examination-material-or-equipment">Examination Material or equipment</h2>
<p>We have been informed by the Associate Dean for Education for the ANU College of Business and Economics that there will be no "in person" examinations held by ANU in Semester One of 2022. As such, the exam for this course will be administered online. Given this, there will be no restrictions imposed on the materials that may be used during the exam. The final exam will be invigilated over Zoom. As such, you will need to have a working web camera that is operational for the duration of the exam. You will also be required to hand-write your answers to the final exam. This means that you will need appropriate paper and writing instruments, along with either a Digital scanner or a phone or tablet with an appropriate scanning application. (ANU has some advice on how to use the "cam scanner" application for the purpose of scanning hand-written assessment items for digital submission.)</p>                                                    <h2 id="required-resources">Required Resources</h2>

It has no digital copies, but has at least one physical copy, of Chiang and Wainwright (2005), Dixit (1990), Kreps (1990), Kreps (2013), Landsburg (2014), Leonard and Long (1992), Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995), McCloskey (1985), Perloff, Smith, and Round (2014), Silberberg and Suen (2001), Simon and Blume (1994), and Takayama (1985). While the ANU library does not have either a digital copy or a physical copy of Bergstrom and Varian (2014), it does have a physical copy of an earlier edition of this book (Bergstrom and Varian, 1996). While the ANU library does not have either a digital copy or a physical copy of Hirshleifer, Glazer, and Hirshleifer (2005), it does have at least one physical copy of some of the earlier editions of this book. In particular, it has at least one physical copy of the fourth edition of this book (Hirshleifer, J (1988), <em>Price theory and applications (fourth edition)</em>, with the assistance of M. Sproul, Prentice-Hall, USA). The ANU library does not appear to have either a digital copy or a physical copy of either Corbae, Stinchcombe, and Zeman (2009) or Takayama (1993). I will request that all physical copies of the above editions of these books that are available in the ANU library system, along with Bergstrom and Varian (1996) and Hirshleifer (1988), be placed on short loan for the duration of this course. (Note that, when multiple editions of one of these books exists, it probably does not matter which edition you consult.)</p><p><br></p><p>Books relevant to this class can be found in both the Chifley Library (which houses most of the ANU Library’s economics collection), the Hancock Library (which houses some of the ANU Library’s economics collection and most of the ANU Library’s mathematics collection), and the Law Library (which houses some of the ANU Library's economics collection). I strongly encourage you to familiarise yourself with, and make use of the resources contained in, each of these branches of the ANU Library.</p>                                                    <h2 id="staff-feedback">Staff Feedback</h2>

<p><strong><em><u>Work-Load Expectations</u></em></strong></p><p>The amount of work required for successful completion of this class may vary between students. As a rough guide, students should expect to devote&nbsp;<em><u>at least</u></em><u>&nbsp;</u>10 hours a week to this class. This should include all of the following.</p><ul><li>3 hours a week: attending lectures.</li><li>1 hour a week: attending tutorials (except for teaching week one).</li><li>At least 6 hours a week: reading, research, writing, lecture preparation, and tutorial preparation.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong><em><u>Required Equipment</u></em></strong></p><p>You will need a computing device with a working web-camera that is capable of running both Zoom and Wattle for this course. The web-camera will only be required for the final exam.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em><u>Teaching Arrangements</u></em></strong></p><p><strong><u>Lectures</u></strong></p><p>Lectures in this course will be "live" events that are held "in person". When available, recordings of the lectures will be provided via the ECHO360 link on the Wattle site for this course at some point after the conclusion of the relevant lecture. While it is hoped that the lecture recording system will provide recordings of suitable quality for each lecture in this course, there is no guarantee that this will be the case. Please note that replacement recordings will not be made in the event that the recording of a lecture fails to be produced by the automatic lecture recording system or is of low quality. In such an event, you might need to make do with the lecture notes in the event that you were unable to attend the lecture. (If there is a suitable replacement recording from a previous instance of this course or some other course that is readily available, then I might post it if such an event were to occur.)</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Tutorials</u></strong></p><p>Beginning in week two, there will be a weekly tutorial held in this course. Tutorials in this course will be "live" events. These will be held "in person" for the most part, although there will be at least one online tutorial held over Zoom to cater for students that have not yet been able to come to the ANU campus. Please note that the tutorials will not be recorded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em><u>Reading Guide</u></em></strong></p><p><strong><u>Topic 0.1: Administrative Arrangements for the Course.</u></strong></p><p><u>Core Reading</u></p><ul><li>The course syllabus.</li><li>The administrivia lecture notes for the course.</li><li>The Wattle site for the course.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Topic 0.2: An Introduction to Microeconomics</u></strong></p><p><u>Core Reading</u></p><ul><li>Varian, HR (2014),&nbsp;<em>Intermediate microeconomics: A modern approach (ninth edition)</em>, WW Norton and Company, USA: Chapters 1 and 16, and the Mathematical Appendix.</li></ul><p><u>Supplementary Reading</u></p><ul><li>Alchian, AA, and WR Allen (1983),&nbsp;<em>Exchange and production: Competition, coordination and control (third edition)</em>, Wadsworth, USA: Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 20.</li><li>Alchian, AA, and WR Allen (2018),&nbsp;<em>Universal economics</em>, Edited by JL Jordan, Foreword by WR Allen, Liberty Fund, USA: Chapter 1.</li><li>Becker, GS (1993), "Nobel lecture: The economic way of looking at behavior",&nbsp;<em>The Journal of Political Economy 101(3)</em>, June, pp. 385-409.</li><li>Case, KE, RC Fair, and SM Oster (2017),&nbsp;<em>Principles of Economics (Twelfth Edition) (Global Edition)</em>, Pearson Education, Italy: Chapters 1 and 2.</li><li>Frank, RH (2006),&nbsp;Microeconomics and behavior (sixth edition), McGraw-Hill, USA: Chapter 1.</li><li>Friedman, M (1953), "The methodology of positive economics", pp. 3-43 in Friedman, M (1953), <em>Essays in positive economics</em>, The University of Chicago Press, USA.</li><li>Gans, J, S King, M Byford, and NG Mankiw (2018),&nbsp;<em>Principles of microeconomics (seventh Asia-Pacific edition)</em>, Cengage Learning Australia, China: Chapters 1, 2, and 3.</li><li>Hamermesh, DS (2006),&nbsp;<em>Economics is everywhere (second edition)</em>, McGraw-Hill Irwin, USA: Chapter 1.</li><li>Heyne, P (2000),&nbsp;<em>A student’s guide to economics</em>, Edited by JA Eglarz, Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) Books, USA.</li><li>Heyne, PL, PJ Boettke, and DL Prychitko (2014),&nbsp;<em>The economic way of thinking (thirteenth edition)</em>, Pearson Education, USA: Chapters 1 and 2.</li><li>Hirshleifer, J, A Glazer, and D Hirshleifer (2005),&nbsp;<em>Price theory and applications: Decisions, markets, and information (seventh edition)</em>, Cambridge University Press, USA: Chapter 1.</li><li>Kreps, DM (1990), <em>A course in microeconomic theory</em>, Princeton University Press, USA: Chapter 1.

<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>

<ul><li>You will not be assessed on either attendance or participation in this course. Nonetheless, both attendance and active participation might well enhance your enjoyment of the course and your understanding of the material covered in the course.</li><li>Lectures in this course will be "live" events that are held "in person". When available, recordings of the lectures will be provided via the ECHO360 link on the Wattle site for this course at some point after the conclusion of the relevant lecture. While it is hoped that the lecture recording system will provide recordings of suitable quality for each lecture in this course, there is no guarantee that this will be the case. Please note that replacement recordings will not be made in the event that the recording of a lecture fails to be produced by the automatic lecture recording system or is of low quality. In such an event, you might need to make do with the lecture notes in the event that you were unable to attend the lecture. (If there is a suitable replacement recording from a previous instance of this course or some other course that is readily available, then I might post it if such an event were to occur.)</li><li>Beginning in week two, there will be a weekly tutorial held in this course. Tutorials in this course will be "live" events. These will be held "in person" for the most part, although there will be at least one online tutorial held over Zoom to cater for students that have not yet been able to come to the ANU campus. Please note that the tutorials will not be recorded.</li></ul>                                                <h2 id="examination">Examination(s)</h2>

A scanned copy of your handwritten assignment is fine. You are not required to type up your answers. However, in order for your assignment to be marked, it must be legible to the grader. If it is not legible, then a mark of zero will be awarded.</li><li>Each assignment should be submitted by 8:00 am on the Monday at the beginning of the week in which the relevant tutorials are held (that, in teaching weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11), unless that Monday is a public holiday in Canberra. If the Monday is a public holiday in Canberra, then the assignment should be submitted by 8:00 am on the first regular business day thereafter.</li><li>If you have trouble submitting your assignment through the turnitin link, then please email a copy of that assignment to the course email address (<a href="/2023/course/ECON8025">ECON8025</a>@anu.edu.au). Any such email must be received no later than 08:00:00 am on the day that the assignment is due in order for your assignment to be marked.</li><li>You will typically receive the questions for each assignment at least half a week before it is due.</li><li>No late submissions will be accepted. Any assignments that are not submitted by the due date and time will receive a mark of zero.</li><li>In each of these assignments, one question will be chosen for assessment and your mark for that assignment will be based on your response to that question. The identity of the selected question will only be revealed upon release of the marked assignments.</li><li>Each of these five tutorial assignments will be worth 2 % of your overall mark for this course. This means that this assessment component is worth 10 % of your mark for this course in total.</li><li>We will endeavour to release comments and marks for these assignments via "Turnitin" by 5:00 pm on Mondays in Teaching Weeks 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (that is, in the week after they are submitted).</li><li>Each tutorial assignment will be allocated a non-negative integer mark out of four. A mark of four will be awarded to very good answers for the selected question. These are "high distinction" level answers. A mark of three will be awarded to good, but not very good, answers for the selected question. These are either "distinction" or "upper-end credit" level answers. A mark of two will be awarded to alright, but not good, answers for the selected question. These are either "lower-end credit" or "pass" level answers. A mark of one will be awarded to poor answers for the selected question. These are "fail" level answers. A mark of zero will only be awarded if no answer is submitted for the selected question.</li><li>All learning outcomes are relevant for this assessment task.</li></ul>

<p><b>Final Exam.</b></p>
<ul><li>We have been informed by the Associate Dean for Education for the ANU College of Business and Economics that there will be no "in person" examinations held by ANU in Semester One of 2022. As such, the exam for this course will be administered online through the Wattle site for the course. This would involve a three hours and forty-five minute exam period in total, incorporating fifteen minutes of reading time, three hours of writing time, and thirty minutes for scanning, compilation, and submission. There will be no restriction on permitted materials for this exam.</li><li>The exam will be invigilated over Zoom. You will be required to have a working web-camera that is turned on during the duration of the total exam period (including reading time; writing time; and scanning, compilation, and submission time). Both your work area and yourself will need to be in view during this time.</li><li>No writing will be permitted during either the reading time or the scanning, compilation, and submission time.</li><li>Your exam must be neatly hand-written. It must not be typed.</li><li>The exam will be comprehensive, in the sense that questions can potentially be drawn from any component of this class. This includes any material that is covered in lectures, or covered in tutorials (including both tutorial questions and additional practice questions), or covered in assigned readings, or covered in some combination of these sources.</li><li>The date and time of the final exam will be determined by the central administration of the ANU. It will occur sometime during the official final exam period.</li><li>The final exam is worth 60 % of your overall mark for this class.</li><li>You will be able to request a breakdown of your mark for the final exam by question (and by each part of each question) after the official release of results for the semester.</li><li>All learning outcomes are relevant for this assessment task.</li></ul>
