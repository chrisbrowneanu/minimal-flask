<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>
<p>Marks that are allocated during Semester are to be considered provisional until formalised by the College examiners meeting at the end of each Semester. If appropriate, some moderation of marks might be applied prior to final results being released.</p>                                                <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>Students are expected to attend all classes and to be active participants, taking responsibility for their own learning along the way.  There will be opportunities for discussion and peer learning throughout the course as a means to build your technical, critical and communication skills. Participation is particularly important for the final group project. </p>                                                <h2 id="examination">Examination(s)</h2>

<p><b>Pre-recorded Presentation </b></p>
<p><strong>Value: 15%</strong></p><p><strong>Details of task: </strong>For this presentation you will be asked to analyse and compare 2 artworks from the list provided. To support your analysis reference 2 relevant texts, 1 can be from the class readings and the other needs to come from your own research. Structure your presentation by answering all of the following prompts:</p><p>For each artwork</p><ul><li>Distinguish the different disciplines, media or processes that are combined in the artwork.</li><li>What tensions, synergies or associations do these combinations produce?</li><li>Support your critique of the aspects and qualities that you have identified by drawing from an academic text.</li></ul><p>In comparison</p><ul><li>Which aspects of each artwork do you find most or least* successful and why? *If you do not think the artwork is successful it is okay to say so, but you still need to back up why.</li><li>What would you like to apply or test from this analysis in your own work in this course?</li></ul><p><strong>Format: </strong>7-minute pre-recorded power-presentation submitted to Wattle. Final slide to include a bibliography that must be formatted precisely using the Chicago style.

<p><b>Material Tensions Challenge</b></p>
<p><strong>Value: 40%</strong></p><p><strong>Details of task: </strong>Class activities undertaken in both Ceramics and Textiles between Weeks 2-7 investigate the themes of material transformations, connectivity, structure and agency through research, making and discussion. On completion of the workshop rotations, you will begin to expand your skills and critical approach to these themes by using the artwork that you have made so far as component parts for new constructs and installations. In Week 8, choose 2-3 Material Tensions Challenge prompts to respond to by combining media and methods in new exploratory ways. Document your process of experimentation and evaluation as you work. For assessment in Week 9, select the most successful response to reinstall along with supporting documentation from Week 8 activities and a 200–300-word rationale which explains how you met each challenge you faced. </p><p><strong>Format: </strong>Installation, supporting documentation and written rationale assessed in class Week 9.<strong> </strong>Install your most successful response along with annotated sketches and or photographs from Week 8 these can either be in a visual diary or loose. Print out a 200–300-word rationale including your name and the specific Material Tensions Challenges you responded to, indicating which one you have reinstalled. </p><p><strong>Please refer to Wattle for full guidelines and the WHS requirements for this task</strong></p>

The ANU has made a number of third party, online, databases available for students to use. Use of each online database is conditional on student end users first agreeing to the database licensor’s terms of service and/or privacy policy. Students should read these carefully. In some cases student end users will be required to register an account with the database licensor and submit personal information, including their: first name; last name; ANU email address; and other information.<br>In cases where student end users are asked to submit ‘content’ to a database, such as an assignment or short answers, the database licensor may only use the student’s ‘content’ in accordance with the terms of service – including any (copyright) licence the student grants to the database licensor. Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.<br>If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>
