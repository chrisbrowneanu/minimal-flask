<p>This course is intended to provide students who have not previously studied competition law, with an introduction to the legal, economic and regulatory foundations of competition law and policy in Australia. &nbsp;<br><br>This course will look at the way firms attempt to exercise market power or otherwise attempt to manipulate the market in order to eliminate or substantially lessen competition; to the detriment of consumers.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s about how the Federal government attempts to prevent this sort of anticompetitive conduct through enforcement of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (&ldquo;the CCA&rdquo;). &nbsp;<br><br>But since firms are controlled by people, at another level, this course is really about greed for profit, lust for power, blatant manipulation, secret factions, ruthless betrayal, spiteful vengeance, high-handed arrogance, ludicrous corporate rationalizations, political farce and the occasional win for justice.<br><br>The last five years have seen an extraordinary amount of legislative change to Australia&rsquo;s competition and consumer protection regimes and in 2010, the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No 2) 2010 (Cth) (&ldquo;the Amendment Act&rsquo;) introduced the Australian Consumer Law.&nbsp; Although the Amendment Act does not affect the restrictive trade practices regime, it did rename the former Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (&ldquo;the CCA&rdquo;).<br><br>From 1 January 2011, the CCA was re-named as the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (&quot;the CCA&quot;) and it is this legislation that will be explored in this course. In particular, it will focus on Part IV of the CCA; the Part that prohibits various forms of anticompetitive conduct.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>
<p>Marks that are allocated during Semester are to be considered provisional until formalised by the College examiners meeting at the end of each Semester. If appropriate, some moderation of marks might be applied prior to final results being released.</p>                                                <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>For all courses taught in any mode (whether face to face or online), the ANU College of Law considers participation in the classes offered to be an important part of the educational experience of the program. Students are expected to attend all classes.</p><p><br></p><p>If circumstances arise which are beyond a student’s control and they are unable to attend a class, the student should contact the Course Convenor in advance (where possible), so that the convenor can adjust their expectations in relation to numbers for that class. If it is not possible to give advance notice, students should send the convenor an email as soon as possible with evidence to support the reason for failure to attend.&nbsp;</p>                                                <h2 id="examination">Examination(s)</h2>

<p><b>Take Home Assessment</b></p>
<p><strong>Details of Task:</strong> The Final Take-Home Assessment consists of one hypothetical problem. There are 5 short questions. Questions 1, 2 and 3 are worth 10% each. Questions 4 and 5 are worth 5% each. Answer the short questions as problem questions and not as answers to theory questions. In other words, you do not need an introduction or conclusion. Please use headings (e.g. Person X v Person Y), sub-headings (e.g. Section 46 of the CCA), and sub-sub-headings (e.g. Predatory pricing). This will help with focus of your answers and save words.</p><p><u>Hint:</u> Although the break-down of the word limit to each question is left to your own judgment, as a rule of thumb, I suggest that you portion <em>around</em> 600 words per questions 1, 2 and 3 and <em>around</em> 300 words for questions 4 and 5.</p><p><strong>Focus of Topics</strong></p><p>In terms of assessment, the follow <strong><u>may</u></strong> be included:</p><p>All relevant definitions that were discussed in class (e.g. market, market power, substantial lessening of competition (including s 4G), contract, arrangement or understanding, purpose, effect or likely effect, provision, concerted practice, etc.);</p><p>Accessorial liability and attempt to contravene (i.e. ss 75B and 76(1)(b)-76(1)(f) of the CCA);</p><p>Cartel conduct provisions (i.e. ss 45AD, 45AF, 45AG, 45AJ and 45AK);</p><p>Contracts, arrangements or understandings that restrict dealings or affect competition (i.e. s 45(1));</p><p>Misuse of market power (i.e. s 46(1));</p><p>Exclusive dealing (i.e. ss 47(1) - 47(10));</p><p>Resale price maintenance (i.e. ss 48(1) and 48(2), 96(1)-96(3), 96A and 97);</p><p>Mergers and Acquisitions (i.e. ss 50(1) - 50(3));</p><p>Notification (i.e. s 93); and</p><p>Authorisation (i.e. s 88).</p><p>In terms of competition law, the following is <strong><u>not</u></strong> included:</p><p>Exceptions to cartel provisions (i.e. s 45AL – s 45AU);</p><p>Secondary Boycott provisions (i.e. s 45DA to s 45EB);</p><p>Misuse of Market Power – corporation with substantial degree of power in the trans-Tasman market and No immunity from jurisdiction&nbsp;in relation to certain New Zealand laws (i.e. ss 46A and 46B);</p><p>Dual listed company arrangements&nbsp;(i.e. s 49);</p><p>Acquisitions that occur outside Australia (i.e. s 50A);</p><p>Exceptions (i.e. s 51);</p><p>Concurrent operation of State and Territory laws.</p><p>Public and Private Remedies.</p><p><strong>Nature of Task: </strong>Compulsory and non-redeemable. Failure to complete will result in a mark of zero for this task.</p><p><strong>Weighting:</strong> 40%</p><p><strong>Assessment Type: </strong>Hypothetical Problem Question</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>9am, Monday 31 July 2023 via WATTLE</p><p><strong>Due Date: </strong>5pm, Monday 7 August 2023 via Turnitin. Late submissions (without an extension) are permitted, but late penalties will apply.&nbsp;If you experience extenuating circumstances and cannot attempt the assessment on the due date and time, you should apply for an extension <a href="https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flaw.anu.edu.au%2Fforms%2Fassessment-extension-request).&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPhilippa.Ryan%40anu.edu.au%7C53cfaf11bd994cb3ef8008daf911f0c8%7Ce37d725cab5c46249ae5f0533e486437%7C0%7C0%7C638096152691615377%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2FDRTrg1jXPfCStLJfxxMnkdVtq7nmdung4hK3Gm4jlg%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here.</a> The College will give you one final opportunity to complete the assessment, at the same time one week later.</p><p><strong>Estimated Return Date: </strong>30 August 2023</p><p><strong>Word limit: </strong>2,500 words (inclusive of headings, but footnotes are excluded), with a 10% leeway is given.</p><p><strong>Submission: </strong>Your submission must be made in a word processing file format (.doc, .docx).

Each student will likely have their own approach. As a suggestion, <u>and only a suggestion</u>, I recommend that you do, at least, the following:</p><ol><li>View and familiarise yourself with the provisions of the CCA that we covered in class on Austlii (e.g. cartel provisions, ss 45, 46, etc.);</li><li>Read at least 2-3 cases (or at the very least summaries of those cases) under each heading from the reading list I have provided online, if you have not already;</li><li>Listen to the lectures on competition law that were uploaded online, if you have not already;</li><li>Read the Perci material online, if you have not already and</li></ol><p>Have a try at the Sample Hypothetical Problem. <u>I note that I will be going through this in some detail in our final class.</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Marking and Comments</strong></p><p>For the sake of clarity, marking will be <em>primarily</em> focused on:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Identification of correct legal issues; <em>and</em></li><li>Analysis and application of the law to the facts (both in terms of reference to the correct legislative provision(s) (or sub-provisions) and relevant case-law).</li></ol><p>Ancillary marks will be awarded for:</p><ol><li>Presentation;</li><li>Structure;</li><li>Written expression; and</li><li>Footnotes (AGLC 4th ed required).</li></ol><p>Please see Marking Rubric below.</p>
