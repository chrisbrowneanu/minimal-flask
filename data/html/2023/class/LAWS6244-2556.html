<p>This course examines how disputes are dealt with as they progress towards hearing by a court. It looks at techniques of dispute resolution with a focus upon litigation. The course is compulsory for both the LLB and the JD and its successful completion is required by the Supreme Court if a student seeks to be admitted as a barrister or solicitor.</p><p><br></p><p>This course not only explains how cases get to a court hearing and what the court expects the parties to do to prepare the matter for hearing, it also examines how disputation is processed en route and looks at the broader policy questions which underpin the design of the justice system.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is taught late in the LLB/JD degrees and it is taught with the expectation that you have a good understanding of earlier substantive law courses such as Tort and Contract. It is possible to undertake the Property and Corporations Law courses alongside this course but you should stay up to speed in those courses otherwise you will get lost in this course. This course is complementary with the Evidence course as the two areas of knowledge are dealt with together in practice. Often the procedures dealt with in this course will provide a gateway to aspects of your studies in Evidence. However Evidence and LDM are independent courses; the order in which you do them is unimportant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This course meets the requirements of the Law Admissions Consultative Committee Prescribed Academic Areas of Knowledge for Civil Dispute Resolution.&nbsp;</p><p>This course meets the following requirements of the Law Admissions Consultative Committee Prescribed Academic Areas of Knowledge for Equity:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>injunction&nbsp;</li><li>declaration</li></ul>

<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>
<p>Marks that are allocated during Semester are to be considered provisional until formalised by the College examiners meeting at the end of each Semester.

<p><b>Optional Group Work</b></p>
<p><strong>Details of Task: </strong>Students may choose to engage with this course using a 'flipped classroom' approach. A flipped approach involves discussing the the tutorial problem in small groups <strong><u>before</u></strong>&nbsp;engaging with any of the relevant content for eg. the lectures. You are not expected to do anything to prepare for these group discussion sessions, or to know any relevant content whatsoever. The focus of these sessions is to gain experience in collaborating with others to find out answers to problems that you don't necessarily have the answers to. It allows students to share problem solving techniques, tips and insights and<strong> </strong>receive<strong> </strong>early feedback. This experience is designed to replicate 'real world' experience of problem solving in a 'law firm' environment. It is expected that your understanding of the course material will be enhanced through engagement in this optional assessment.</p><p>Students will be expected to actively participate in all 5 sessions (held during odd weeks of semester). Each session will involve breaking into smaller groups (of 3-7 students, depending on numbers), discussing issues, identifying what you already know and don't know, outlining a research strategy and deciding how you will work together over the next week to prepare your responses to the problem questions for discussion during tutorials the following week (held in even weeks). (Note: These sessions are in addition to, and not the same as, the course tutorials. It is <strong>not necessary</strong> that students in the small group for a session need to be in the same tutorial group).</p><p>If you choose to opt in for this option task, you will need to sign up to an online group session by the end of Week 2. More details will be provided, but there will be two group sessions (both held online) on Mondays (9am - 11am and 6pm - 8pm). Each group will be capped at 50 students. Places in each group will be given on a first in, first served basis.</p><p>To be eligible for a mark in relation to this assessment task, you will need to participate in that the same group session each fortnight (5 sessions in all). At the end of participation in the 5 sessions, students will create a 4 minute video where they reflect on the experience, specifically the content and the activities (flipped classroom, small group collaboration, research orientated), and how they have (or have not) assisted in their learning in LDM and overall.</p><p><strong>Session participation:&nbsp;</strong>There is an expectation that if you sign up for this option, you will attend all 5 sessions unless there are exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances. You may withdraw from this assessment at any time, however if you withdraw, you will not be permitted to rejoin later.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nature of Task: </strong>Optional and redeemable. This means if your mark for this assessment is less than your overall mark for the course, your overall mark will stand and this assessment task will not be counted. However, if your mark for this assessment task is greater than your overall mark for the course, your overall mark will be reduced to 90%, and the mark for this task will comprise the remaining 10%.</p><p><strong>Weighting: </strong>0 or 10%</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> Students may begin preparing their video reflection after their last session in week 11.</p><p><strong style="background-color: inherit;">Duration:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Due Date: </strong>5pm, 22 May 2023 via Wattle dropbox (not Turnitin). Late submissions (without an extension) are permitted, although late penalties will apply.</p><p><strong>Estimated Return Date: </strong>Official end of semester results release date via Wattle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Assessment Criteria:</strong></p><ol><li>Participation in all 5 sessions (unless documented evidence justifying absence as 'unforeseeable and exceptional' is provided)</li><li>Appropriate focus on selected aspects of the tutorial program (flipped classroom, practical focus, group work for eg) for the reflection (the ‘how of learning’)</li><li>Reflection on awareness of ‘self as learner’ as demonstrated through appropriately chosen examples of what might have been learnt in the course (or not)</li><li>Demonstration of personal insight into oneself as a learner (including any barriers/ obstacles/ difficulties)</li><li>Demonstration of acceptance of responsibility of self as learner, including exploration consequences for the future self (as a law student/ lawyer/ professional/ human being)</li><li>Clear links tying together the examples, the content and the change in sense of self</li><li>Clarity of expression (style) and coherence</li></ol>
