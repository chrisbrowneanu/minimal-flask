<p>For the public to be able to make informed decisions about important scientific issues, they need to have access to accurate yet understandable information. The best vehicle for this is through the print and electronic media. However very few scientists are trained to communicate effectively with the media, which can make informing the public a difficult process.</p><p>This course examines the relationship between science and the media and the cultural differences that often make the relationship difficult. Topics to be covered include an analysis of science-media relations from both the scientists&#39; and journalists&#39; perspective; the style in which science is reported in the media; and how best to present science in the media. This is a skills-based course, the aim of which is to train science students in the production of material suitable for publication or broadcast in the popular media. Students will have opportunities to practice the skills of this course in &lsquo;real life settings&rsquo; gaining valuable industry experience and contacts.</p>

                                Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
                            </p>
<ol><li>Identify and apply the
processes involved in getting an issue into the media<br></li><li>Apply the basics of

</li><li>Discuss, and where
appropriate explain, current issues in journalism </li><li>Differentiate the
communication needs of various audiences</li><li>Evaluate the
suitability of topics for different media, and examine and select appropriate
background material for a story</li></ol>
                            <h2 id="research-led-teaching">Research-Led Teaching</h2>
<p>This course encompasses the four main aspects of research-led teaching. There is a focus on research content; the curriculum is structured around the existing body of literature in the field and the core theoretical understandings. Students are encouraged to actively critique and reflect upon the literature in their own analyses of science in the media. This provides students with a sense of the research process and problems as the course examines how the ‘treatment’ of science in the media has changed over time, and how the concept of ‘best practice’ has also evolved. The course also contains a core element of research process, as students are required to undertake their own original research for the majority of the assessment tasks, including for an external organisation.</p>                                                                                                                            <h2 id="required-resources">Required Resources</h2>

You must provide evidence that you have considered where your target audience accesses information or how you can put your information effectively in front of them.

<p><b>Feature article - option 3/3  (value 25%)</b></p>
<p>In this assignment you are to find a science researcher (from ANU or elsewhere) and interview them about their research. Then find a person who can provide a human interest storyline to illustrate the science. Write the two interviews up as a feature article (approx 1000-1500 words), including one or two illustrative images. You can suggest images, you do not need to take them yourself. You should aim to make your article suitable for publication in a magazine. Please specify which magazine you would pitch this piece for.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Assessment Rubrics</u></strong></p><p>Marking explanation</p><p>Grading will be based on:</p><ul><li>Topic choice: Features require sustained interest from the reader and should be relatively timeless, not relying too strongly on a news item (but can refer to news events).</li><li>Structure/Storyline: A catchy opening of the story, to grab the reader. The story you have chosen should illustrate the science featured in the article. Your grade will reflect how well you incorporate science in your story and how well you explain it. The story needs to weave throughout the theme (what the feature is actually about). We need to go somewhere in the story, either back to where we started or to somewhere new. Does the feature take the reader on a journey?</li><li>Interviewees: You need to interview at least two people. These marks are being allocated for the appropriateness of the scientific representative and the choice of the person to run the storyline. You also must attribute your interviewees appropriately.</li><li>Language: This covers things like readability of the story, whether it is interesting, whether quotes have been handled well, whether information is attributed and whether the document has been proof read.</li><li>Explain science: Features often go much broader and therefore don’t include a huge amount of science, but the science that is there should be well explained.</li><li>Image: This assignment does not ask you to take a picture but to make suggestions as you would to an editor if you were submitting the work. You will get more points if you add captions to explain what the thinking was behind an image (particularly for fairly generic images).</li><li>Pull out: They should be part of the text, snappy, eye catching and summarise some part of the story.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Word limit: 1,000 – 1,500 words in total (leeway of ±10% without penalty)</p>

                    <h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
Academic integrity is a core part of our culture as a community of scholars. At its heart, academic integrity is about behaving ethically. This means that all members of the community commit to honest and responsible scholarly practice and to upholding these values with respect and fairness. The Australian National University commits to embedding the values of academic integrity in our teaching and learning. We ensure that all members of our community understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity. The ANU expects staff and students to uphold high standards of academic integrity and act ethically and honestly, to ensure the quality and value of the qualification that you will graduate with. The University has policies and procedures in place to promote academic integrity and manage academic misconduct. Visit the following <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/academic-honesty-plagiarism" target="_blank">Academic honesty & plagiarism website</a> for more information about academic integrity and what the ANU considers academic misconduct. The ANU offers a number of services to assist students with their assignments, examinations, and other learning activities. The <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/learning-development" target="_blank">Academic Skills and Learning Centre</a> offers a number of workshops and seminars that you may find useful for your studies.                                                <h2 id="onlinesubmission">Online Submission</h2>
The ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. While the use of Turnitin is not mandatory, the ANU highly recommends Turnitin is used by both teaching staff and students. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the ANU Online website.
                    <h2 id="hardcopysubmission">Hardcopy Submission</h2>
For some forms of assessment (hand written assignments, art works, laboratory notes, etc.) hard copy submission is appropriate when approved by the Associate Dean (Education). Hard copy submissions must utilise the Assignment Cover Sheet. Please keep a copy of tasks completed for your records.                                                <h2 id="latesubmission">Late Submission</h2>
<p>Late submission of assessment tasks without an extension are penalised at the rate of 5% of the possible marks available per working day or part thereof. Late submission of assessment tasks is not accepted after 10 working days after the due date, or on or after the date specified in the course outline for the return of the assessment item. Late submission is not accepted for take-home examinations.</p><p><br></p>                                                <h2 id="referencing-requirements">Referencing Requirements </h2>

Extensions and late submission of assessment pieces are covered by the Student Assessment (Coursework) <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_004603" target="_blank">Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_004604" target="_blank">Procedure</a> The Course Convener may grant extensions for assessment pieces that are not examinations or take-home examinations. If you need an extension, you must request an extension in writing on or before the due date. If you have documented and appropriate medical evidence that demonstrates you were not able to request an extension on or before the due date, you may be able to request it after the due date.                                                                                                        <h2 id="privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</h2>
The ANU has made a number of third party, online, databases available for students to use. Use of each online database is conditional on student end users first agreeing to the database licensor’s terms of service and/or privacy policy. Students should read these carefully. In some cases student end users will be required to register an account with the database licensor and submit personal information, including their: first name; last name; ANU email address; and other information.

In cases where student end users are asked to submit ‘content’ to a database, such as an assignment or short answers, the database licensor may only use the student’s ‘content’ in accordance with the terms of service — including any (copyright) licence the student grants to the database licensor. Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.

If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>
