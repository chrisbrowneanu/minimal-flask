<p>In this course, students engage in advanced, in-depth explorations of various aspects of the social psychology of groups and group life. Students will engage in depth in the analysis of the social and psychological process of social categorization into groups, the interdependencies between individuals and groups, and the cognitive, attitudinal and behavioural consequences of both social categorization and social interdependence. Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to examine current understandings of group interactions (e.g., deviance, norms, &amp; decision making), pro-social behaviours (e.g., cooperation, helping, trust, &amp; fairness), social change and collective action, social influence, and stereotyping and prejudice. The course, itself, strongly integrates theory with laboratory and field data, allowing students to gain a solid understanding of advanced, contemporary insights into a range of social behaviours.</p><p><br></p><p>A key feature of this course is its emphasis on the importance of theory in developing an understanding of group life. This emphasis on theory, however, is balanced by a rigorous laboratory program designed to complement the lectures, while simultaneously providing hands-on lessons in experimental social psychology. Throughout the course, students will design an experiment; complete a Human Research Ethics Application; and write a formal research report Introduction, hypothesis, Methods and Results. Students will learn key features of social-psychological experimental design, including the manipulation and measurement of variables of interest, scale construction, hypothesis testing, data interpretation, as well as abstract methodological concepts such as “mediation” and “moderation”.</p><p><br></p><p>Critically, this course not only provides students with a supported and structured environment in which to gain a deep understanding of the social psychology of group life, but it equips students with a variety of graduate attributes (also known as employability skills) identified as important for the development of a productive workforce. Specifically, students develop an ability to communicate effectively and contribute to scholarship in social psychology; to solve problems, take individual initiative, and think critically; to understand ethical values in research; and to make sense of evidence. Achieving at high levels in this course requires good self-management, planning and organization skills.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an Honours Pathway Course.</p>

<ol><li>Have a broad understanding of the social psychology of group life, including an understanding of interdependence, categorization, and the cognitive, attitudinal and behavioural consequences of the social psychology of group life, including interdependence and categorization.</li><li>Have a deep understanding of how social identity and self-categorization processes affect the pattern and progression of group life.</li><li>Have gained deeper insight into the manner in which a diverse set of social-psychological phenomena can be examined and understood by a single meta-theoretical framework and, in doing so, gain an appreciation for the role and value of theory in social psychology.</li><li>Have a deeper understanding of nature and practice of social-psychological research.</li><li>Be able to write two key components of a social-psychological research report (Introduction & Method), and complete a Human Research Ethics Application.</li></ol>

<p>Students will be required to attend an in-person examination. The only exceptions will be where COVID restrictions prohibit this or where students are unable to travel to Australia because of COVID related reasons; these latter students will be required to complete an invigilated on-line examination. Other relevant information will be provided at a later date. Be sure to attend all lectures and read all information provided on the <a href="/2023/course/PSYC3002">PSYC3002</a> 2023 Wattle site once you have enrolled in this course.

<p>Ability to attend laboratory classes in person is essential, unless the student can provide formal written documentation indicating an inability to attend in person for COVID-related reasons or for those students who are not able to travel to Australia because of COVID-related reasons. In these situations, prohibiting in-person laboratory classes, remotely delivered (via Zoom) laboratory classes will be offered.

The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://services.anu.edu.au/business-units/anu-online" target="_blank"> ANU Online website</a> Students may choose not to submit assessment items through Turnitin. In this instance you will be required to submit, alongside the assessment item itself, hard copies of all references included in the assessment item.                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>
Marks that are allocated during Semester are to be considered provisional until formalised by the College examiners meeting at the end of each Semester. If appropriate, some moderation of marks might be applied prior to final results being released.                                                <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>The Research School of Psychology considers the laboratory component of all courses to be an integral part of each course – laboratory classes may supplement and consolidate material covered in lectures or they may introduce entirely new material pertinent to the objectives of the course. As such, attendance at laboratory classes is considered to be essential (even if this attendance is done electronically to satisfy COVID restrictions).</p><p><br></p><p>It is therefore the policy of the Research School of Psychology that students will attend all laboratory classes scheduled for any course. Absences must be notified (in advance, if possible) to the tutor or course convenor, and accompanied by adequate and appropriate documentation justifying the absence. Only reasons entirely beyond the student’s control and unable to be anticipated and adjusted for at the beginning of the course will be accepted – reasons will be restricted to illness or significant personal crisis, and the accompanying documentation must be a medical certificate or other professional evidence of incapacity to attend. Clashes with other courses or with work commitments will not be accepted as reasons for absence since these can be anticipated and adjusted for at the beginning of the course.</p><p><br></p><p>Note that laboratory attendance includes participating in the laboratory experiments, interacting with other students (both interpersonally and to the laboratory class as a whole), completing tasks on a computer, and completing hand-written assessment tasks.</p>                                                <h2 id="examination">Examination(s)</h2>
<p>The final exam for <a href="/2023/course/PSYC3002">PSYC3002</a> must be completed in person unless this is not possible due to COVID restrictions; other than COVID-based restrictions, there is no take-home exam for this course. Students registered with ANU Access and Inclusion may be provided with specific assistance (to be determined in consultation with Access and Inclusion).</p><p><br></p><p>Please note, that where a date range is used in the Assessment Summary in relation to exams, the due date and return date for mid-semester exams indicate the approximate timeframe in which the exam will be held; the due and return date for end of semester exams indicate the approximate timeframe in which the exam will be held and the date official end of Semester results are released on ISIS. Students should consult the course wattle site and the ANU final examination timetable to confirm the date, time and venue of the exam.</p>

Academic integrity is a core part of our culture as a community of scholars. At its heart, academic integrity is about behaving ethically. This means that all members of the community commit to honest and responsible scholarly practice and to upholding these values with respect and fairness. The Australian National University commits to embedding the values of academic integrity in our teaching and learning. We ensure that all members of our community understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity. The ANU expects staff and students to uphold high standards of academic integrity and act ethically and honestly, to ensure the quality and value of the qualification that you will graduate with. The University has policies and procedures in place to promote academic integrity and manage academic misconduct. Visit the following <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/academic-honesty-plagiarism" target="_blank">Academic honesty & plagiarism website</a> for more information about academic integrity and what the ANU considers academic misconduct. The ANU offers a number of services to assist students with their assignments, examinations, and other learning activities. The <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/learning-development" target="_blank">Academic Skills and Learning Centre</a> offers a number of workshops and seminars that you may find useful for your studies.                                                <h2 id="onlinesubmission">Online Submission</h2>
The ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. While the use of Turnitin is not mandatory, the ANU highly recommends Turnitin is used by both teaching staff and students.

<p>Not permitted</p>                                                                            <h2 id="privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</h2>
The ANU has made a number of third party, online, databases available for students to use. Use of each online database is conditional on student end users first agreeing to the database licensor’s terms of service and/or privacy policy. Students should read these carefully. In some cases student end users will be required to register an account with the database licensor and submit personal information, including their: first name; last name; ANU email address; and other information.

In cases where student end users are asked to submit ‘content’ to a database, such as an assignment or short answers, the database licensor may only use the student’s ‘content’ in accordance with the terms of service — including any (copyright) licence the student grants to the database licensor. Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor, potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.

If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative arrangements that are available.                                                <h2 id="distribution-of-grades-policy">Distribution of grades policy</h2>
Academic Quality Assurance Committee monitors the performance of students, including attrition, further study and employment rates and grade distribution, and College reports on quality assurance processes for assessment activities, including alignment with national and international disciplinary and interdisciplinary standards, as well as qualification type learning outcomes.

Since first semester 1994, ANU uses a <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/grading-scale" target="_blank">grading scale</a> for all courses. This grading scale is used by all academic areas of the University.                                                <h2 id="support-for-students">Support for students</h2>
