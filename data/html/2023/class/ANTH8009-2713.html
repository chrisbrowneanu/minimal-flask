                                Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
                            </p>
<ol><li>understand the range of organisations involved in development work and the issues they face in delivering strong development outcomes;</li><li>critically appraise such organisations in terms of their effectiveness and identify which development institution is most relevant in a particular context; and</li><li>appraise a development project or policy in terms of the likely political and institutional constraints.</li></ol>

<p>The distinctive research led features of the course are the topics on NGOs, Philanthropic Foundations, and China as a Donors are all based on Dr Kilby's research and relevant chapters from his books will be used. He is the Editor in Chief of the Journal Development in Practice. In addition, he chairs a Delegated Human Research Ethics Committee which gives him unique insights into the ethics of development. He has written extensively on gender and development and has received research grants for this work</p>                                                    <h2 id="field-trips">Field Trips</h2>

<p>This course will use the online learning management system—WATTLE—to provide resources in a digital form. If there are technical issues please advise Patrick Kilby immediately. You can log on to WATTLE using your ANU student number (uXXXXXXX) and ANU (ISIS) password: for the course and program details are all on the WATTLE site. There is also a MAAPD Program WATTLE Page which is a useful guide to the broader University Resources available. </p><p>There is a direct link to each of the required readings via the Library, and for each topic there is also a link to a sub-directory of Supplementary readings, which may also be of interest for that particular topic. The list of supplementary readings for each week is often quite long, and so it is not expected that you read them all, but rather have a look at the abstract or first paragraph of each and if it interests you then keep reading. These readings are intended to give you an idea of the breadth of ideas on a particular topic so you can extend your knowledge beyond what is discussed in class and is expected of the course. The supplementary list for each week is regularly updated. Note that the required and supplementary readings are accessed through the ANU Library, and as such are protected by copyright, and so are for the use of ANU students and staff only. </p><p>A suggested book for the course is on NGOs and development issues is Kilby, P. (2011) NGOs in India: The Challenges of Women’s Empowerment and accountability, Routledge, London; which available free online or can be purchased as paperback.</p>                                                    <h2 id="staff-feedback">Staff Feedback</h2>

<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>
