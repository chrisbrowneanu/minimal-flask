<p>This course examines the nature and place of international organisations in world politics. Attention is given to why international organisations were formed, how they operate, and what role they play in contemporary international affairs. The course begins with a survey of different theoretical approaches to understanding and explaining international organisations. Attention is then turned to a series of institutional groupings to look at the United Nations system, economic organisations, security, development, and the environment. Throughout, the course considers how new configurations of global power are changing the landscape of international organisations.</p>

                                                                            <h2 id="additional-course-costs">Additional Course Costs</h2>
<p>Besides one required textbook, there are no additional costs associated with this course.</p>                                                    <h2 id="examination-material-or-equipment">Examination Material or equipment</h2>
<p>Details about the material or equipment that is permitted in an examination room will be outlined during the semester and on the course’s Wattle site.</p>                                                    <h2 id="required-resources">Required Resources</h2>
<p>The following textbook is <strong>required</strong>:</p><p style="padding-left: 20px">Ian Hurd, <em>International Organizations: Politics, Law, Practice</em>, Third Edition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018).</p><p>Due to copyright issues, the textbook’s chapters will <strong>not</strong> be uploaded on Wattle. You should purchase your own copy for the best learning experience. Please note that you are required to study the <strong>3rd</strong> edition—but neither the 2nd edition nor the 4th edition—because the 3rd edition contains considerable new information that is missing in the 2nd edition while the 4th edition does not add much new information regarding the book chapters you are required to read. The final exam questions will be presented, based upon that requirement. The textbook should be available as a used copy for purchase at Amazon Australia, AbeBooks or eBay. In addition, the ANU has six copies of the 3rd edition of the textbook for students who do not wish to purchase their own copy.</p><p>A number of articles and book chapters are also <strong>required</strong> and can be downloaded from Wattle, along with supplementary recommended readings.</p>                                                    <h2 id="recommended-resources">Recommended Resources</h2>

<p>The information provided is a preliminary Class Outline. A finalised&nbsp;version will be available on Wattle and will be accessible after enrolling in this course. All updates, changes and further information will be uploaded on the course Wattle site and will not be updated on Programs and Courses throughout the semester. Any questions or concerns should be directed to the Course Convener.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Course Logistics</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p>It is the ANU’s official policy that “ANU will complete the full transition to pre-pandemic modes of study in 2023” (go to <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/covid-19-advice#returning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.anu.edu.au/covid-19-advice#returning</a> for more details). In accordance with ANU policy, our course is delivered in an <strong style="color: black;">in person</strong> mode only. Lectures will be held in person in Haydon-Allen Building (#23) Lecture Theatre “The Tank” on Mondays, 1:05-2:55 pm, and lecturer-created video will be recorded using the Echo360 platform. Each recording should be available on Wattle after each class. However, I cannot guarantee the integrity of the recording, meaning that while attendance at lectures is not compulsory, it is the only way to ensure you receive the full benefit of the lecture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please <strong style="color: black;">note</strong> (1) that due to copyright issues, you are required not to circulate the lecture recordings beyond the ANU; and (2) depending on the focus of the course, the audio-visual materials we will watch in class may contain graphic and/or disturbing images.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tutorials will be held in person on campus in Weeks 2-11. There is no tutorial in Weeks 1 and 12. Please <strong style="color: black;">note</strong> that due to its budgetary situation, the CASS has decided to provide tutorial support for 10 weeks only (not the usual 11) and to put 30 students in each tutorial, and that faculty members had no say in this decision. As such, our course’s tutorial situation is the CASS’ sole responsibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You are expected to arrive to class on time, as late arrivals are disruptive to your fellow students. Please <strong style="color: black;">note</strong> that the use of mobile phones, including text messaging, is strictly prohibited in class. Please do <strong style="color: black;">not</strong> use your laptop computer during class for non-class activities (for example, email or web-surfing unrelated to class) because it detracts from your fellow students’ learning experience.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Extensions and penalties</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p>As Wattle is the only acceptable way that you can submit your written assessments, you do <strong>not</strong> need to hand in a hard copy of your written assessments. <strong>Your submission time will be determined by the time at which your written assessment has arrived within the dropbox as marked by Wattle Turnitin in our course Wattle.</strong> Uploading a wrong assessment (for example, a paper for a different course than ours) is no submission and will result in zero for a given assignment. Also, submitting your assessment to a wrong place (for example, the Turnitin practice site) is no submission until and unless you complete uploading it on our proper course Wattle. It is <strong>your</strong> responsibility to ascertain that your assessment has been properly uploaded on Wattle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extensions and late submission of assessment pieces are covered by the Student Assessment (Coursework) Policy and Procedure. The course convener may grant extensions for assessment pieces that are not examinations or take-home examinations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There will be no extensions granted, except for a documented medical or family emergency. If you need an extension, you must request it in writing <strong>on or before the due date</strong>. That is, <strong>you must contact your course convener via email before 11:00am, 27 March 2023 for the Theoretical Memo, and before 11:00am, 8 May 2023 for the Research Paper.</strong> Also, you must provide your course convener with appropriate <strong>verifying documentation at the time of your request</strong>. Acceptable verifying documents include (but are not limited to) <u>an Education Access Plan letter from the A&amp;I Office, a medical certificate, a pharmacist’s note, a text-message or email notification for self-isolation, quarantine or vaccination, and a support letter from an ANU residential wellbeing coordinator or ANU Counselling</u>. Per ANU policy (specifically, Article 11 of Procedure: Student Assessment (Coursework)), if you have a documented and appropriate medical evidence that proves you were completely incapacitated and thus could not reasonably have been expected to request an extension on or before the due date, you may be able to request it after the due date. <strong>Note</strong> that in case you might request a second extension after receiving the initial extension, the same ANU policy on extensions will apply to your case: you must contact your course convener before your extended due date expires <strong>and</strong> with appropriate updated documentation at the time of your second request. Please <strong>note</strong> that the maximum length of extension granted will be limited by the School’s policy on extensions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Per ANU policy (specifically, Article 16 of Procedure: Student Assessment (Coursework)), “The due date of an assessment task is not extended beyond the date for return of the assessment item specified in the course outline.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Late submission of assessment will be accepted with the following penalty per the ANU’s Student Assessment (Coursework) Policy and Procedure. Late submission of assessment tasks without an extension are penalised at the rate of 5% of the possible marks available per working day or part thereof. Late submission of assessment tasks is not accepted after 10 working days after the due date, or on or after the date specified in the course outline for the return of the assessment item.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note that you have almost the entire semester to work on your research paper. Thus, time management is your responsibility. </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Extension is not granted for take-home examinations because I will give you enough time based upon my prior consultation with the Access and Inclusion Office.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Late submission is not accepted for take-home examinations as per the ANU rules.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Academic Integrity</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Academic misconduct can seriously jeopardise your academic career, your future, and, if you are an international student, your ability to stay in Australia to study. It is the responsibility of each individual student to ensure that:</p><p><br></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are familiar with the expectations for academic honesty both in general, and in the specific context of particular disciplines or courses</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work submitted for assessment is genuine and original</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate acknowledgement and citation is given to the work of others</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do not knowingly assist other students in academically dishonest practice.</p><p><br></p><p>Please <strong style="color: black;">note</strong> that I have zero tolerance for academic dishonesty including cheating, plagiarism, collusion, fabrication/submission of work that is not original, and recycling. Academic dishonesty will be punished by disciplinary action at the University level. For more details on the ANU’s Academic Misconduct Rules and what constitutes a breach of these rules, please see: <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2021L00997" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2021L00997</a> (Academic Integrity Rule 2021),</p><p><a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/academic-honesty-plagiarism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/academic-honesty-plagiarism</a> (Academic honesty &amp; plagiarism), and</p><p><a href="http://drss.anu.edu.au/asqo/breaches.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://drss.anu.edu.au/asqo/breaches.php</a> (What is a breach?). Specifically, the ANU defines plagiarism as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Plagiarism is copying, paraphrasing or summarising, without appropriate acknowledgement, the words, ideas, scholarship and intellectual property of another person. This remains plagiarism whether or not it is with the knowledge or consent of that other person. <strong>Plagiarism has also taken place when direct use of others' words is not indicated, for example by inverted commas or indentation, in addition to appropriate citation of the source</strong> (emphasis added).”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It must be noted that intention does <strong>not</strong> matter for determining whether plagiarism has occurred: Whether intentional or not, plagiarism is plagiarism and, if the end result of your writing constitutes plagiarism, it will be punished as such. Also, please note that <strong>self-plagiarism (that is, reusing, in whole or in part, one’s own previous work for our course assignments) is plagiarism and will be punished equally</strong>. As the guideline for avoiding plagiarism in all your course assignments, you <strong>must</strong> refer to the section, “Successful vs. unsuccessful paraphrases,” which is available at the following webpage <a href="https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/assignments/quotingsources/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/assignments/quotingsources/</a>. This resource is also available at the end of the PDF version of this course outline on Wattle.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Referencing requirements</u></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a requirement of this course that your essay conform to academic writing standards and referencing. <strong>The Chicago referencing style is required</strong>: you may use either in-text notes or footnotes. You may contact the ANU Academic Skills and Writing Centre for further advice.

For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>

At the end of the semester, 1 point will be deducted from participation for each tutorial missed after the second (i.e. you can miss 2 tutorials without penalty). Accordingly, if you attend 6 tutorials total (missing 4), the maximum score you can get for participation is 8/10, given the 2-point deduction (and this assumes perfect participation for those tutorials you do attend).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Note</strong> that if you may arrive late in the tutorial session, it is <strong style="color: black;">your</strong> responsibility to double check whether your tutor has marked your presence.</p>                                                <h2 id="examination">Examination(s)</h2>

<p><b>Theoretical Memo</b></p>
<p><strong>Due date</strong>: Monday 27 March 2023, 11:00am sharp. <strong>Value</strong>: 15%. <strong>Word limit</strong>: 800 words.</p><p><strong>Details of task:</strong> Students must write a brief memo comprising the following three components:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(a)&nbsp;Select an international organisation that <strong>currently exists</strong>. (If you select an organisation <u>not</u> covered in the Course Outline, <strong>you must get the permission of your tutor or lecturer before you start to write about it</strong>. Also, you must write about an <u>intergovernmental</u> organisation, not a nongovernmental organisation or international law. For example, the Interpol is <u>un</u>acceptable since it was established as an international NGO, not an IO.) Identify the founding treaty or documentation for that organisation and the number of members as of 1 January 2023. [<strong><em>Note this part does <u>not</u> count towards the 800 word limit</em></strong>]</p><p>(b)&nbsp;Briefly introduce the issue domain in which the IO operates, and describe <strong>at least one</strong> fundamental cooperation problem faced by states in that area (i.e. in the absence of an IO) explicitly in terms of the Prisoner’s Dilemma game you will learn in <em>Week 2</em> lecture on neoliberal institutionalism. In other words, what could states achieve or gain by cooperating (i.e. working through an IO in that area)? As a corollary, what could states lose by not cooperating? Please <strong>note</strong> that it is <strong>not</strong> enough for you to merely mention this or that interstate problem, such as information shortage. Instead, a crucial part of your answer is that your memo should explain how the incentive structure of interstate relationships in the IO’s issue domain is a Prisoner’s Dilemma-like situation, as covered in <em>Week 2</em> lecture. What you need to demonstrate is an analysis of how states’ interests are specifically harmed by an absence of cooperation in that issue domain, and of why, in the absence of the IO, states have incentives to refuse to cooperate in that issue domain. [<strong><em>300-400 words</em></strong>]</p><p>(c)&nbsp;Using neoliberal institutionalist (NLI) theory, outline <strong>only two</strong> mechanisms created by the IO that help states overcome the cooperation problem. (As we will see in class, NLI specifies up to 4 mechanisms – but you won’t have the words to cover that many. Examine what you think are the two most relevant mechanisms for the IO.) This part requires you to think about how you can use NLI theory to <u>characterise</u> the things your specific IO is supposed to do to facilitate interstate cooperation. Importantly, note that you are <u>not</u> providing any analysis of whether the IO actually succeeds in achieving these things – that comes in the next assessment!&nbsp;[<strong>400-500 words</strong>]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grading criteria:</strong> Your theoretical memo will be graded based on the following criteria: </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(1)&nbsp;the quality of your analysis—this includes both your demonstrated theoretical understanding of the underlying cooperation problem and the mechanisms for states to overcome it, and generally your general ability to execute the instructions; and</p><p>(2)&nbsp;the overall quality of writing, including structure, spelling and grammar. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Remember – you will need to select a different IO for the main research essay – so perhaps pick your “second” favourite IO to do this task – or even pick something that takes you out of your comfort zone!</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additional submission instructions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Turnitin does not accept certain file types (for example, Mac’s word processing program), please use only the <strong style="color: black;">Microsoft Word or PDF</strong> file formats for uploading your memo at Wattle.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are required to use <strong style="color: black;">the </strong><strong>Chicago Style of referencing</strong> that employs either in-text or footnote citations (of the author and year, page if direct quotation). You then type the complete citation in a “bibliography” (use the subheading) at the end of your document. Also, use footnotes (but not endnotes) for any brief explanations needed which are not integral to your argument.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Details on the ANU website: <a href="https://academicskills.anu.edu.au/resources/handouts/referencing-style-guides" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://academicskills.anu.edu.au/resources/handouts/referencing-style-guides</a> </p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your word count <u style="color: black;">excludes</u> your bibliography and tables/figures.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We prefer you use 12 point Times New Roman, double-spacing, and standard one-inch (2.54 cm) margins.

<p><b>Research Paper</b></p>
<p><strong>Due date</strong>: Monday 8 May 2023, 11:00am sharp. <strong>Value</strong>: 35%.</p><p><strong>Word limit:</strong> <strong style="color: black;">2</strong><strong>,200 words of text</strong> in length, <strong style="color: black;">excluding</strong> footnotes (or endnotes), the references, tables, figures, appendices, and the cover sheet, if any, from the word count. Per ANU College of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, an assignment must not deviate from the prescribed word limit either up or down by more than 10%. In other words, the acceptable word count for your paper is minimum 1,980 and maximum 2,420 words of text.</p><p><strong>Details of task:</strong> Using <strong><u>a different international organisation</u></strong> than the one selected for the theoretical memo, students must write an essay on the following topic:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>“How can the theory of neoliberal institutionalism explain the founding of </em>[your chosen IO for this essay]<em>, and how would it explain the organisation’s record of success? How would the theory of realism / constructivism </em>[choose one]<em> respond to these arguments?” </em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How should you go about writing on this particular essay topic? In my view, a useful way of us offering advice is to outline, in advance, an essay structure that <strong style="color: black;">we believe</strong> can result in a very good essay. Your course convener’s “suggested” structure is extremely narrow and prescriptive and, if you choose to follow it, you may find this at times a source of frustration. However, that’s the point—this is how <em style="color: black;">a well-trained IR scholar</em> would write the essay, and as such constitutes a certain kind of “feedback,” albeit offered before you’ve written the research essay! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Having said that, you are not bound to follow this structure. Ultimately, it is your choice how to build an argument and analysis to answer this question. However, all good essays will excel in the grading criteria specified below. If you choose to follow your own path, you <strong style="color: black;">must</strong> still seek to meet these criteria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grading criteria:</strong> Your research paper will be graded based on the following criteria: </p><p>(1)&nbsp;the quality of the argument including both your theory development and empirical analysis; </p><p>(2)&nbsp;the overall quality of writing, including structure, spelling and grammar; and</p><p>(3)&nbsp;the quality and appropriateness of the research, including proper attribution and referencing. </p><p><br></p><p><u>Course convener’s suggested structure</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(A) Introduction</strong></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>In this section you will need to cover two broad themes: First, why did states decide to create this organisation; and second, what problem(s) is it designed to solve? Introduce your essay by discussing the issue area covered by the international organisation (IO). Why is this issue important to states, and what could they achieve by cooperating? What are the challenges that limit the scope for cooperation in the absence of an IO; in other words, what types of problems is the IO designed to solve and why would states (in theory at least) want to join it? </em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Importantly, your introduction will look a bit like the work you did in part (b) of the theoretical memo, this time with your second IO. </em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(B) Theoretical analysis </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>In this section you will need to outline the mechanisms the IO uses to achieve its objectives. To do this, specify the formal objectives of the IO and then proceed to describe what the IO actually does in practice.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The next part is critical: <u>characterise</u> these activities theoretically; in other words, through what mechanisms does the IO help states cooperate and work together? This discussion will look a bit like the work you did in part (c) of the theoretical memo, this time with your second IO. &nbsp;However, this section should be longer and more sophisticated than the prior memo – consider </em><strong><em>all four</em></strong><em> mechanisms outlined by NLI and whether and how they may operate in practice. </em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(C) Empirical assessment </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>In this section you will need to evaluate how successful the organisation has been at achieving its objectives, and why? The “why” is all-important here. Try to explain the track record of the IO’s success (or failure), and use this analysis to make an argument about the empirical validity of the neoliberal institutionalist approach to international organisations. How good is NLI theory at explaining what we actually observe? The content of this section will obviously be brand new research. </em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(D) Critiques and concluding analysis</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>In this final section, choose </em><strong style="color: black;"><em>either realism or constructivism (but not both)</em></strong><em> as a competing theoretical perspective, and ask, what are the main criticisms that can be made by the competing theory against your neoliberal institutionalist explanation of the IO provided above? Specifically, are there any theoretical gaps or empirical anomalies not fully resolved by neoliberal institutionalism in your analysis? Does neoliberal institutionalism help counter these criticisms effectively? Why? If not, why not? Finally, what is your conclusion about the superiority of neoliberal institutionalism as the dominant approach to international organisations? Conclude your argument by discussing the prospects for the IO’s future success. The content of this section will obviously be brand new research. </em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Research paper – General Comments</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The aim of this essay is to demonstrate knowledge of the different theories of international organisations, and connect these theories to a sophisticated analysis of the workings and record of the IO. In other words, you are writing about an international organisation by making a theoretically-informed argument and supporting it with empirical evidence – this is the basis of a good research paper in the social sciences. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additional submission instructions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case your paper topic overlaps with empirical case studies covered in the course, your paper must demonstrate substantial independent research.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please do <strong style="color: black;">not</strong> copy any part of the suggested research paper structure that we have outlined above into your research paper (you can use the headings “introduction,” “theory,” etc).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your paper should cite at least <strong style="color: black;">five</strong> (5) different outside references that are not assigned in the course.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A critical book review will <strong>not</strong> be accepted.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Turnitin does not accept certain file types (for example, Mac’s word processing program), please use only the <strong style="color: black;">Microsoft Word or PDF</strong> file formats for uploading your paper at Wattle.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are required to use <strong style="color: black;">the </strong><strong>Chicago Style of referencing</strong> that employs either in-text or footnote citations (of the author and year, page if direct quotation).
