<p>This course focuses on the creation of clearer and more effective ways to communicate scientific matters to larger audiences. It provides participants with a thorough and practical understanding of the process used in developing a communication plan including the development of a strategic framework and accompanying action plan that allocates resources, responsibilities and timeframes. It has a strong emphasis on relating theory to current industry best practice in implementing a strategic approach to planning communication activities. The major project component is based around field work and evaluation of real life science communication strategies.</p>

<p>The course is based on research into the development of science based communication strategies and supported by current industry based examples. The need for a strategic based approach to science communication has been informed by research undertaken by Lawrie Kirk. This research investigated science communication capacity building needs for Pacific NGOs, resulting in a recommendation for ways that NGOs could respond to UNESCO’s new strategic direction.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The approach used in this course for the development of a science based communication strategy and supporting tactical plan has also been successfully used and demonstrated in the UK, Asia, Australia, Canada and the USA. The workshop technique for delivering tactics has been continually tested since its development in 2006 and is annually revised prior to the delivery of each intensive course. The most recent review of this approach was for a commercial application in the UK in June 2018 where the approach was tested and compared against a range of current coaching and collaborative techniques.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This course is highly research-led in at least four ways:</p><ul><li>the course readings and lecture content cover influential and current examples of science communication strategies;</li><li>in one workshop activity you will learn the skills needed to critically differentiate between strategy and tactical activities and how to facilitate a group activity to select and prioritise communication tactics;</li><li>in the first assignment, you will undertake a desktop review of an existing science communication strategy and analyse this data to present your findings, emulating a presentation to a project Steering Committee or Management Board; and</li><li>in phase 2, you will read and summarise communication information from the selected communication strategy and translate this into a concise report that reviews the strengths and weakness of the existing strategy as well as prioritised communication tactics for that organisation.</li></ul>                                                                                                                            <h2 id="required-resources">Required Resources</h2>

<p><strong>Course Overview</strong></p><p>This course provides a thorough and practical understanding of the process used in developing a communication strategy. It includes the development of a strategic framework and a tactical plan that allocates resources and time frames. The focus is on how to ensure your science communication activities work together and with other parts of an organisation. What does a science related communication strategy look like? How can I get segment my audiences? How do I select and prioritise communication activities? and how do I evaluate the success of my communication activities?</p><p><br></p><p>Topics include the development of a communication strategy, defining communication outcomes, segmenting your audience and defining desired relationships with stakeholders. There is a focus on encouraging students to select and prioritise science communication activities. Skills gained in strategy development and tactic selection provided in this course are also applicable to many other nonscientific areas.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why study this course?</strong> This course builds on successive courses held since 2006. An intensive week residential school will be used to deliver the course. The course has two key phases and the proposed outcomes for each lecture and tutorial are provided in the course schedule below. Emphasis is place on developing an agreed strategic approach within the context of science communication. The outputs from this course can be utilised by the participants to undertake a practical review of how a science based organisation approaches their planning and delivery of communication activities.</p><p class="ql-indent-1"><br></p><p class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Phase one - Building a strategic approach to communication planning</strong>. In this phase the students will be shown how to take a more strategic approach to communication planning using a process that has been developed and refined by the course conveners over the past 20 years. There are two assessable pieces of work related to this phase; a presentation to the group at the end of the week and a report of a desktop review of a science based communication strategy. This report is to be delivered after the residential course. The presentation and the report require the students to show their understanding of the strategic process by undertaking a desktop review of an organisation’s communication strategy. Support for developing both assessable pieces of work will be provided by group work and tutorials during the residential week. There will be one video tutorial via Zoom during the week starting 18th September; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide further guidance (if required) on the report. The date and time for this tutorial will be finalised with the participants during the course.</p><p class="ql-indent-1"><br></p><p class="ql-indent-1"><strong>Phase two – Developing a communication tactical plan</strong>. In this phase the students will be shown an interactive workshop technique that assists a group in developing a tactical plan. Learning is reinforced by an assessable piece of work where the students will be required to present their findings at the end of the week and then submit a report on the tactical aspects of the strategy reviewed in Phase one. Tutorials and a group demonstration of the interactive workshop technique are provided to assist in students in the assessable work.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Referencing </strong></p><p>Science communication students can use any recognised academic reference system of their choosing in SCOM courses, provided referencing is complete, comprehensive and correct. Referencing and academic literature searching will be discussed in lectures, tutorials and readings in the first half of the course.</p>                                                    <h2 id="class-schedule">Class Schedule</h2>

<p><b>Assignment 1- Presentation of preliminary desktop findings</b></p>
<p>This task will require the participant to present their desktop assessment of a science-related communication strategy and supporting tactics.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> This task will require the participant to present their desktop assessment findings of a science related communication strategy. Each participant will need to display a thorough knowledge of both the strategic and tactical planning process demonstrated in this course. This presentation will simulate a real life experience of presenting to a high level Executive, Project Board or Project Steering Committee.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Activity</strong>: Each participant is required present to the rest of the class which may include other CPAS staff and students. For undergraduates this will be a maximum 10 min presentation (plus 5 min question time) on their key findings from investigation of the strategic intent and tactical delivery of a science related communication strategy. For postgraduate students (<a href="/2023/course/SCOM6501">SCOM6501</a>) the presentation will be a maximum of 15 minutes and 5-minute question time. The expectation is that the presentation will be to a professional standard and demonstrate expert review and critical analysis. Prior to the presentation there will be an opportunity for each participant to establish the context and background to the organisation that was reviewed. The order of presentation is determined by random selection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Presentation</strong>: The presentation is to be based on an assumption that the audience represents the Executive of the relevant organisation or a Project Steering/Management Committee. The key findings of the analysis and any recommendations for improvement need to be clearly and effectively articulated. To be eligible for assessment, all presentations are to be delivered on Day 5 (Friday 8th September 2023). Presentations may commence on the afternoon of Thursday 7th September, depending on class size. Note that presentations will be recorded to assist with marking. </p>

<p><b>Assignment 2 - Communication strategy</b></p>
<p>Each participant is required to understand the development of the strategic intent of a Communication Strategy through a desktop review of a science related Communication Strategy. They will also be required to then report on how they have identified and analysed the tactical planning aspects associated with the selected Communication Strategy. Postgraduate participants will be required to demonstrate expert review and critical analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> This task will require the participant to demonstrate a thorough knowledge of the strategic and tactical communication planning process demonstrated in this course. Activity: Each participant is required to understand the development of the strategic intent of a Communication Strategy through a desktop review of a science related Communication Strategy. They will also be required to then report on how they have identified and analysed the tactical planning aspects associated with the selected Communication Strategy.</p><p><br></p><p>A desktop review is an industry term that requires a person not to undertake primary research but undertake an assessment using information that is publicly available. You MUST NOT undertake primary research by contact with the organisation, as that requires clearances from the University. Assistance will be provided in tutorials dedicated to this piece of assessment.</p><p><br></p><p>The presentation on Friday 8th September will also provide an opportunity for peer review and feedback that can be included in the written report that is due after the presentation.</p><p><br></p><p>The following are the minimum areas that need to be covered in the report:</p><ul><li>Identification of key communication partners and audiences with groupings and categories</li><li>Relationships – are they defined for each partner and if so what are they?</li><li>Key communication messages</li><li>Communication objective(s)/Outcomes</li><li>Key performance indicators (measurement or evaluation criteria)</li><li>Identification of specific tactics used and prioritisation</li><li>Measurement and evaluation of the tactics chosen.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Presentation:</strong> The reporting, analysis and recommendations on suitability of the information reviewed <strong><u>must not exceed 10 A4 pages (12 pt font).</u></strong> An executive summary must be provided at the start of the report and is included within the 10 page limit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> Postgraduate students are expected to demonstrate an advanced understanding of the concepts covered in this course, specifically the difference between a communication strategy and supporting tactical plan. The page length and marking breakdown will remain the same for all class participants but the postgraduate presentation is expected to be of a higher standard. The postgraduate report will need to demonstrate critical analysis supported by scholarly literature. Recommendations will also need to be directly linked to the critical analysis with the overall report keeping within the 10 page limit.&nbsp;Submissions over 10 pages may be reviewed and feedback provided but the content on additional pages will not contribute to the final mark.</p>

<p>Academic integrity is a core part of the ANU culture as a community of scholars. The University’s students are an integral part of that community. The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2021L00997#_Toc35619227" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academic integrity principle</a> commits all students to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support, academic integrity, and to uphold this commitment by behaving honestly, responsibly and ethically, and with respect and fairness, in scholarly practice.</p><p><br></p><p>The University expects all staff and students to be familiar with the academic integrity principle, the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/about/governance/legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Integrity Rule 2021,</a> the <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Policy: Student Academic Integrity</a> and <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6477150" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Procedure: Student Academic Integrity</a>, and to uphold high standards of academic integrity to ensure the quality and value of our qualifications.</p><p><br></p><p>The Academic Integrity Rule 2021 is a legal document that the University uses to promote academic integrity, and manage breaches of the academic integrity principle. The Policy and Procedure support the Rule by outlining overarching principles, responsibilities and processes. The Academic Integrity Rule 2021 commences on 1 December 2021 and applies to courses commencing on or after that date, as well as to research conduct occurring on or after that date. Prior to this, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L02025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Misconduct Rule 2015</a> applies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The University commits to assisting all students to understand how to engage in academic work in ways that are consistent with, and actively support academic integrity. All coursework students must complete the online Academic Integrity Module (Epigeum), and Higher Degree Research (HDR) students are required to complete research integrity training. The <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Integrity website</a> provides information about services available to assist students with their assignments, examinations and other learning activities, as well as understanding and upholding academic integrity.</p>                                                <h2 id="onlinesubmission">Online Submission</h2>
<p>You will be required to electronically sign a declaration as part of the submission of your assignment. Please keep a copy of the assignment for your records. Unless an exemption has been approved by the Associate Dean (Education) submission must be through Turnitin which is available on the Wattle page of this course. </p>
                    <h2 id="hardcopysubmission">Hardcopy Submission</h2>
<p>For some forms of assessment (hand written assignments, art works, laboratory notes, etc.) hard copy submission is appropriate when approved by the Associate Dean (Education). Hard copy submissions must utilise the Assignment Cover Sheet. Please keep a copy of tasks completed for your records.</p>                                                <h2 id="latesubmission">Late Submission</h2>
<p>No submission of the first assessment task without an extension after the due date will be permitted. If an assessment task is not submitted by the due date, a mark of 0 will be awarded. If you missed the deadline due to serious circumstances that were unforeseen and outside of your control, that genuinely prevented you from completing this assessment, and you have a medical certificate or other authoritative evidence to support your claim, then the Course Convener will set alternative assessment to avoid unfair disadvantage to you. If you need an extension, you must request it in writing on or before the due date. If you have documented and appropriate medical (or other) evidence that demonstrates you were not able to request an extension on or before the due date, you may be able to request an extension after the due date.</p><p>Irrespective of when you request it, to receive an extension you must provide a copy of any evidence that documents why you need an extension (e.g. medical certificate, counsellor’s note, police report, etc). You will be granted the extension only if the circumstances necessitating an extension are beyond your control and could not have been reasonably anticipated, avoided or guarded against. Ongoing disabilities and medical conditions are a possible exception to this; if you are registered with Access and Inclusion and they have determined that you may be entitled to extensions routinely.</p><p><br></p><p>Late submission of assessment tasks without an extension are penalised at the rate of 5% of the possible marks available per working day or part thereof. Assignments submitted more than 10 working days after the due date, or on or after the date specified for the return of the assessment item, will not be accepted and will receive a mark of zero.</p>                                                <h2 id="referencing-requirements">Referencing Requirements </h2>
