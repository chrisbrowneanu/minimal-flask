<p>How can humour – and what kind of humour – be used in science communication? What does comic performance offer to understanding the public image and pop cultural narratives of science? What can we learn from comic scientists about science? (e.g. in the <em>Nutty Professor</em> films or comic <em>Frankenstein</em> stories) How can we use the Joker – ‘spreading’ laughter in DC comics and animated films – to teach virology? Or what does Todd Phillips’s 2019 <em>Joker</em> blockbuster teach us about neurology? What can we learn from the interplay between forensic science and comic zombies in splatstick films (from <em>Braindead</em> or <em>Zombieland</em> to <em>iZombie</em>) for the communication of science?</p><p>Humour, this course elucidates, is not only one of the most powerful tools in communication, and a great way to bring science to the public, but it also shapes – and has been shaping – cultural ideas of sciences. The course thus investigates both, the ways science has influenced and generated rich and fascinating comic traditions in popular culture, and how humour and comic performance have shaped cultural ideas of sciences and ‘science humour’. It looks at the exchange between popular entertainment and science in various media (e.g. comics, film, fiction) over the last 150 years – the course is a conversation between the past, present and future – and clarifies the power of humour for bringing science and scientists into the general public discussion.</p>

                <td>Humour is not only one of the most powerful tools in communication, but it also shapes cultural ideas of sciences. This course will offer students new insights into interconnections between science, comedy and comic performance in culture. We will study contemporary and historical examples to clarify how comic cultural narratives about science have affected the public discourse and understanding of science, and thus our science-society relationship.<br>In this course students will explore how to communicate their academic knowledge and research more effectively through humour – while also gaining more awareness of good practice and responsible, versatile use of nuanced humour in different situations and with different audiences.<br>This online course comprises an intensive component that is undertaken across the period of a week. The intensive week will take place 10-14 July 2023. There may be some short online tutorials or pre-reading before the intensive week.<br>This course is designed like a conference – with thematic sessions revolving around short, specially-created videos (also featuring an array of international guest speakers), discussions and exercises. The intensive week (taught online via Zoom) will consist of highly interactive individual and group activities to consolidate learning and teach skills. Practically-oriented, research-led assessment will continue after the intensive week, with students choosing whether to conduct a research project or create and evaluate a humour-based science communication product (these assessments will be completed in the weeks or months after the intensive week).<br>The course centres on five themes:(Day 1)<strong> “Humour, Science &amp; SciCom: Theories and Contexts” </strong>– We will explore the current state of research around humour and laughter in science and science communication, and different humour theories and practices (including science comedy, science demonstrations, etc.).(Day 2)<strong> “HUMORECTOMY: The Ambivalence and Ambiguities of Humour” </strong>–<strong> </strong>Why be careful with humour?<strong> </strong>– We will investigate the pitfalls and promises of humour in science and science communication, and discuss and evaluate historical and contemporary cultural examples.(Day 3)<strong> “Roaring Machines: Sci-Fi and Techno-Funology” </strong>–<strong> </strong>We will explore how humorous public discourse and comic cultural narratives about technology and science have affected the public discourse and understanding of science and technology.(Day 4) <strong>“Science between Horror and Humour: Clowns and Scientists” </strong>– We will clarify how ‘comic violence’ (e.g. in the form of slapstick, zombie scientists and Joker science) has been a versatile frame for interpreting our relationship with science in popular entertainment.(Day 5)<strong> “Queering Science through Laughter” </strong>– On the last day, we will focus on what good practice is in relation to humour, gender and science, explore the work of queer science show performers and also do some practical exercises in a "Developing your Sense of Humour" session. We will also discuss the report/creative science communication product that students will submit after the intensive week.<br>At the end of this course students will be able to refer to and draw inspiration from different media, stories and cultural contexts intertwining science and humour.</td>

<p>The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/turnitin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academic Skills website</a>. In rare cases where online submission using Turnitin software is not technically possible; or where not using Turnitin software has been justified by the Course Convener and approved by the Associate Dean (Education) on the basis of the teaching model being employed; students shall submit assessment online via ‘Wattle’ outside of Turnitin, or failing that in hard copy, or through a combination of submission methods as approved by the Associate Dean (Education). The submission method is detailed below.</p>                                                <h2 id="moderation-of-assessment">Moderation of Assessment</h2>
<p>Marks that are allocated during Semester are to be considered provisional until formalised by the College examiners meeting at the end of each Semester. If appropriate, some moderation of marks might be applied prior to final results being released.</p>                                                <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>Participation in this course is not assessed, but reflection upon class activities IS assessed in the quiz assessment item (Assessment Task 1: Science and Humour Knowledge Quiz) and the 3-min video (Assessment Task 2). For that reason, attending and participating actively is critically important. In addition, many class activities are very interactive, so it is not possible to record all classes or to have a catch-up session. It is difficult to complete this course without attending the entire intensive week. Actively participating in their own learning will also enable students to get the most out of this course. It is strongly recommended NOT TO MISS any sessions or parts of this course.</p>

<p><strong>Science and Humour Knowledge Quiz</strong></p><p>The teaching videos we will watch in the course will be accompanied by quizzes designed to help you think reflectively and critically about the use, role and power of humour, particularly in science/science communication contexts, and how humour can be used as a science communication tool. This assessment item will help you retain information in an online learning environment and put into practice what you have learned. It will also test the breadth of your learning and understanding of the topics we cover in class. You will be given a specific set of questions and have to choose one or more appropriate answers. You will then receive immediate feedback on how well you did. The results of the quizzes taken together form the grade for this assessment item.</p>

These are the core question of your second assessment task. Based on what you will have learned on Day 1 (humour theories and concepts) and the first part of Day 2 (on the ambiguities of humour and laughter), in the afternoon of the second day of the course you will create a short video explaining why a piece of humour around science - which you can choose - is funny (or not). This can be, for example, a science cartoon, science joke, comic strip about science or scientists, a short comic performance or another comic cultural product exploring a science field, science topic or scientists characters. The videos will be watched and discussed together on Day 3. You will be trained the day before on how to create this video (with Zoom; the technical quality of your video will not be assessed).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Marking criteria</strong></p><p>You must upload the video to Wattle or otherwise make available to the course on Day 3.</p><p>What your assignment should demonstrate:</p><ul><li>Nuanced and intelligent interpretation of a comic cultural artefact revolving around science (define that science, if possible)</li><li><em>Reflection </em>on the particular humour expressed in or embodied by this artefact (referring to the theories and concepts discussed on Day 1) rather than mere <em>description</em></li><li>A well-articulated answer to or discussion of the question: In what light does the specific humour in your example put the science at stake - and what can we learn from it (e.g. about the 'cultural imaginary' of that science)?</li><li>Ideally, your video is engaging, creative and entertaining</li></ul>
