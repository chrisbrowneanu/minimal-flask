    <h1>Naive Assessments of Courses for TD-GA</h1>
    <p>Date Generated: 22-Jul 2024</p>
    <p>Chris.Browne@anu.edu.au</p>
    <p>This report contains a 'naive' assessment of courses. Naive assessments take the Course Outlines and are assessed against the proposed levels of Transdisciplinary Problem-Solving for each element below.</p>
    <img src="rubric.png">
    <p>In general, the following process was followed:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The course desription, learning outcomes and asssesment activities were considered.</li>
            <li>If needed, the class summary was also included - especially if TD elements were unclear in assessment or class activities</li>
            <li>TD elements that were clear in Learning Outcomes are preferred, especially where there is an Assessment item with clear alignment around the TD element.</li>
            <li>Where TD elements are not clear in Learning Outcomes, the level ('Likeliness') was considered more conservatively.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>It is also understood that:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>On occasion, what is in Course Outlines and Class Summaries (the formal curriculum) is not what is emphasised in classes. Please update Course Outlines to emphasise relevant elements if they are missing.</li>
            <li>Bias or other errors may exist in the Naive Assessment. Forgive me, and please share your insights: Chris.Browne@anu.edu.au</li>
            <li>These positions are not authoritative. The authority for inclusion as a TD course sits with College Associate Deans (Education), and endorsement with AQAC/Academic Board.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This report has been generated from the data in: <a href="https://anu365.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/AcademicPortfolioInitiatives/EUeaaoZoaVtHpGK7hFng2rcBiY4c_q2YwvpdSTaZfN9kgQ?e=uSQXGe">TD Course List.xls on Sharepoint</a>.</p>
        <p>No 'decisions' are indicated in the document, though these are tracked in the spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>The report has been organised in two ways: first, by Alpha code, and; second, with some exemplars organised around each TD Element.</p>
